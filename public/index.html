<p>January 1, 2023</p>
<h2 id="dear-international-sound-experiments-team-and-visitors-to-our-website">Dear International Sound Experiments Team (and Visitors to Our Website),</h2>
<p>Today marks the dawn of a new chapter for our organization. I want to start by recognizing the hard work that many of you have contributed to get us to this point. The episodes we’ve released so far reflect moments of brilliance and creativity, and for that, I am grateful.</p>
<p>However, as we step into 2023, it has become clear to me that our previous structure no longer serves the goals of innovation and efficiency that I envision for this company. Effective immediately, International Sound Experiments will be rebranded as Eckenrode Muziekopname (EM). This transformation comes with a significant shift in how we operate—leaner, sharper, and laser-focused on the future.</p>
<p>As part of this realignment, I have made the difficult decision to release a substantial portion of our staff from their positions. This decision, while challenging, is necessary to ensure that EM moves forward unencumbered by the inefficiencies of the past. If you are reading this announcement and have not received a personal email by the end of the day, I regret to inform you that your journey with us ends here.</p>
<p>Moving forward, EM will work with smaller, more agile teams to ensure we are always ahead of our deadlines and at the forefront of creative output. To those departing, I encourage you to reflect on the moments of brilliance you brought to the table. You have my best wishes as you transition to new opportunities.</p>
<p>To the remaining core team, know that I expect a renewed commitment to excellence. Beginning immediately, we will adopt a proactive approach to episode planning. Themes for each episode will be assigned one week in advance, with every department engaging in focused collaboration (“beehive activity”) leading up to the three-day pre-deadline. Improvised or remixed episodes may have a looser structure, but they are the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>The future is bright for Eckenrode Muziekopname, and I look forward to the journey ahead—with those who are ready to embrace this new era.</p>
<p>Sincerely,
Nathan Eckenrode
Founder &amp; CEO, Eckenrode Muziekopname</p>
