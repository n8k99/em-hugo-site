<p>In this very galaxy, a young adventurous bard set out to find what ever he could find. One of the first things that happened in the beginning of this new quest was he was pressed upon by a kind figure to put everything that happens down by pen on paper. And this is exactly what he did.</p>
<p>Over the decades, the many situations and scenarios found their way into The Ritual of Morning Pages. These early meditations captured in many tomes, could possibly now be considered a Library. It is in the early years of adventuring which specifically lead our young bard to the place we are now. Therefore, we find it imperative to begin a process of capturing the essence of these ink bound scratching, in an attempt to decipher his mind.</p>
