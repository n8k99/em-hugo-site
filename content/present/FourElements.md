<p>This week I was focused primarily on creating and recording the tracks for a label EP release. I am super happy with the results of that project but that left me needed tracks for this week's episode.</p><p>Fortunately, last week, I started on the EP and wrote and recorded four tracks which were more conceprual than I really wanted to release on a label. So I "scrapped them" well, by scrapped I mean, I thought they were perfect for this week's episode of the podcast! Plus there is a track embedded in the midst of them from something I was messing around with over the weekend. </p><p>Track titles:</p><ol><li>A Measure of Space</li><li>Chrono-Spatial Collapse</li><li>enigmatic enclosures</li><li>Red Shift-Blue Shift</li><li>Fluxation Entanglements. </li></ol><br/>
