<p>Last week, I prepared a set of songs for the October Edition of Beats &amp; Brews. I selected the first half of my double album from a couple years ago, <strong><u>Chromatic Depression I.</u></strong> These tracks were remixed and remastered using newer techniques and ideas about the songs so that they could be fresh for presentation. Then as a DJ, I mixed these songs together for the crowd to enjoy the numerous interesting sound textures and palettes which they were composed .</p><p>This week's episode is a recording of that mix taken from my controller. </p>
