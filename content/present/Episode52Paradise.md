<p>So I missed last week. I was in the Theatre all week with my son - his HS put on their Senior Showcase and it was exciting to work with him backstage. All the hours I generally put into producing this podcast were spent there.<br/><br/>This week, I have a single piece which is composed straight through. Has elements of both Trance and Drum n Bass. I have been dying to put out a DnB episode and this just snuck into this week&apos;s episode. This is pretty funny to me because I started the whole composition process thinking it was going to be straight House music but things kinda took their own turn as I got into the flow. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
