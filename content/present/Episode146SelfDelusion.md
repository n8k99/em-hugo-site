<p>This weeks' episode of LRM started out as a production schedule for some backing tracks for a trumpet based MainStage 3 Concert file. My aim was to set up some interesting soundscapes with movement throughout the entire concert as a backdrop for the Audio to MIDI tricks I would be employing with my horn. Basically it is a game with myself to get me to play my horn more often at home and do that thing that I resist most, practice. At the moment I am not abandoning this strategy but the welcome pressure of my week publication deadline somewhat demands that the trumpet set up in MS3 take a bit of a back seat, at least for the moment, so that I can publish another exploratory episode of freshly created music. This week's journey goes through some Trip Hop, slight refrains of Dubstep, and finishes with some Psytrance adjacent soundscapes. The track titles are as follows: </p><ol><li>Jane Street Hotel</li><li>Can't Keep Up, Young Thing</li><li>Abstraction #112 (heavily influenced by Jackson Pollack)</li><li>Dubstep Blues</li><li>Trash</li><li>Damage if you do</li></ol><br/><p>I hope you enjoy listening as much as I did making.</p>
