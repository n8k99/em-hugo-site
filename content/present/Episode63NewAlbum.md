<p>Soooooooo.....<br/><br/>Last Saturday was a chill and productive day. I got into the creative zone and made twelve songs that I say fits quite well into the genre of Generic House Music. This was prompted by an evening at a club where there were Open Decks and the songs I brought were far too hyper and psychotic for the room. So I put together these twelve songs and published them on Bandcamp as an album called <a href='https://music.n8k99.com/album/generic-house-music-album'>Generic House Music Album</a>. So this week&apos;s episode is a mix of these songs. So hooray. New Music you can buy. A New Mix you can listen to and enjoy. And a nice comfortable little set for any Open Deck events I happen to go join up. <br/><br/>Funny thing happened this week. Instead of returning to the same Open Deck event, I had a night of playing electronic music with my synths. Funny how life works out sometimes. Honestly. It&apos;s really exciting. <br/><br/></p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
