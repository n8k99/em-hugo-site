<p>So much of my efforts in creative ventures lately has been pushed into some very intense development of an whole world of narrative, it involves a bunch of intense reading, computer programming and tasks which are both time and energy intensive. This week, I have crested a small hill in that journey and was feeling a little bit disappointed. Feeling a little bit drained and needing a boost. So, I pivoted to something I know helps me. Making Music.</p><p>Here are four tracks:</p><ul><li>If I say goodbye</li><li>Ghost Mode</li><li>Briefly Epic</li><li>Begin2End</li></ul><br/><p>I won't claim that these will be uplifting your spirit and your mind, but the creation of them did exactly that for myself. </p>
