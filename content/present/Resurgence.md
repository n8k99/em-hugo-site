<p>The week's episode is a return to the prodigious creativity. I took a break off last week as I was super involved in operating a fly wire system in the theatre and preparing for a N8K99 show. This week, I am facing the dearth of a long known friend who was a fixture in the local scene here in Jax. Loads of people knew her and the overwhelming flow of emotions surrounding her loss is certain to strike a chord within the local music scene.</p><p>I have also been experimenting with some engineering techniques during this episode. There are a couple of tracks where I built an enitre track with drums, bass, keys, etc and then passed through through sidechains for a completely different beat. This made some interesting combinations of layers and sounds. I am quite pleased that I asked myself "What happens if I do this..."</p><p>In slightly other news, I have returned to making digital art images. I have not broken out of my Cletic Zentangle Mandala yet but in celebration of picking this practice back up, I am using an image from this week for the episode and concurrent Album cover. </p>
