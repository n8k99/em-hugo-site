<p>So this week things changed. I got bored with the same old bullshit and decided to do something different. Something different as in what I used to do a lot, and that is write Ska Punk songs. So what I did was write a bunch of Ska Punk songs. Well, there is also some Funk R&amp;B with some jazzy flavor in this demo as well. After writing all these, I started dreaming that I&apos;d also put together a band to play them. And record them. And play and record some other songs that have yet to be written.<br/><br/>So, let&apos;s call this a demo tape for any potential musicians who would like to be a part of this band. The pieces needed are:</p><ul><li>Drums</li><li>Bass </li><li>Guitar </li><li>Keyboards</li><li>Trombone</li><li>Tenor Sax</li><li>Trumpet</li></ul><br/><p>That&apos;s seven pieces plus me is eight. Big Band, right? Well, it&apos;s Fourth Wave Ska! Nothing says Ska like a three piece horn section and a Singer who can&apos;t sing!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
