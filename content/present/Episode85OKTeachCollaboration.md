<p>This week, I had the rapper OKTeach come into the studio and collaborate with me on an episode. We threw some beats together, made up some lyrics and had a good time with the whole process. The enjoyment of all this is really the making of new music and the connections which we build as artists. I hope the results are as enjoyable to you as they are to us.  </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
