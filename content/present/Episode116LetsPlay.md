In the dream an girl invited him to a Rave where there was a new genre of music playing called "Hit 'EM". The key elements of the genre are 212 bpm, 5/4 time signature and crunchy sounds. Since posting this dream on Twitter, producers have been hot to make tracks in this exciting new genre. Myself included. And here are the tracks for this week's episode:</p><ol><li>Complex Chaos</li><li>Another Trip</li><li>Surprise MF</li><li>Undisturbed Progression</li><li>Some Sort of Journey</li><li>Invincible</li></ol><br/><p>I had a whole lot of fun working on these tracks, and of course one of them breaks one of the rules of the genre, because I had to.</p>
