<p>In this weekâ€™s episode of <em>Living Room Music</em>, N8K99 pulls back the curtain on a new creative frontierâ€”a live performance concept in the works for the upcoming <em>Beats &amp; Brews</em> event on April 20th. This evolving set blends electronic foundationsâ€”Trip Hop, Ambient, House, and moreâ€”with a unique twist: live trumpet performance, converted in real-time to MIDI via MainStage 3 and routed through rich layers of onboard synths. The result? Backing tracks that feel intentionally incomplete, waiting to be brought to life on stage.</p><p>The episode kicks off with two mellow, lofi-inspired tracksâ€”<strong>"Sneak Attack"</strong> and <strong>"Keep it Going"</strong>â€”both tailored to this hybrid setup and offering a glimpse into the sonic space of this project. Then, in a burst of deadline-fueled inspiration, N8K99 takes a sharp left turn into the pulsing world of psytrance. Three brand new tracksâ€”<strong>"Feeling Good"</strong>, featuring Nina Simoneâ€™s iconic vocals, <strong>"For Your Eyes Only"</strong>, a James Bond-flavored reimagining, and <strong>"Left Earth"</strong>, a high-octane psy rompâ€”showcase a different side of the project, pushing the energy way up.</p><p><br></p><p>Tune in for a genre-hopping journey through experimental structure, sampled soul, and future-facing performance conceptsâ€”this episode is a sonic workshop in motion.</p>
