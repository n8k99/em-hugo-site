<p>&quot;The Hag&quot; is a symbolic archetype that appears in various mythologies and folklores throughout history. The Hag is often depicted as an older woman with a wrinkled face, representing the darker aspects of the feminine, such as death, decay, and transformation.<br/><br/>In many cultures, The Hag is associated with witchcraft or supernatural abilities, and is sometimes portrayed as a wise woman or healer. In some traditions, she is seen as a symbol of wisdom and insight, representing the knowledge that comes with age and experience.<br/><br/>In Jungian psychology, The Hag is sometimes considered an aspect of the Shadow, representing the parts of ourselves that we repress or deny. Hearing the voice of The Hag in a dream may indicate the need to confront our deepest fears or face aspects of ourselves that we have been avoiding.<br/><br/>It&apos;s important to note that the meaning and symbolism of The Hag can vary depending on the cultural and historical context. Dreams and personal associations with The Hag may also differ from person to person, and it&apos;s up to the individual to explore their own relationship with this archetype.<br/><br/>check out my Ambient Music Album http://music.n8k99.com</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
