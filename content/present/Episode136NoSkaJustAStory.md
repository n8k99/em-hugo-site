<p>Once again it is time to release a new episode of Living Room Music by N8K99. This past week has been consumed with halfway finished, halfway started coding projects for the Engineering Department of EM. Then yesterday, I got dropped into an complete different narrative cosmos as I was building a world within the geeky fantasy realms for D&amp;D. These projects consume my entire day. But all that is there to show for it is just a fledgling start. Sort of a capactiy to systemize my Google Workspace. Sort of a Discord chatbot. Sort of the ground work for The Ritual, a long form performance art piece leveraging music and visuals, aimed to be somewhat improvisational and open mic type drop in contributions with other musicians. And I still had to put out an episode of new music today. I managed to squabble together six tracks.</p><p>* Desparate Directions</p><p>* I'm trying to tell a story here</p><p>* Shantytown</p><p>* A hunger you feel bad </p><p>* Opening Movement</p><p>* Second Movement</p><p>then because of the way I am feeling about these efforts, as in not very great, I plugged in a Microphone and talked, sang, whistled, or rapped over top of it all in one long take. I don't care, like a Gen X guy. I don't care about the numbers or results. Here is the damn episode. No fancy words to describe it. No AI rewrites for the description. just the straight up me-ness. Of course, I will keep plugging away at my massive EM corporation narrative, and automating things so that when my phone dies I don't worry. Of course, I'll keep trying to build the AI run Technical Development Team, and of course, I will continue to plug away at the Open World concept for the D&amp;D game - maybe turn it in to something else, who knows. And I will continue to put out these episodes no matter whether I have listeners or not. Because Expression is the Opposite of Depression.</p>
