<p>Ever wonder how those massive festival stages get built? Or how theater and concert rigs seem to float in midair? In this video, we’re diving into the wild history of rigging, from sailors working ropes on ancient ships to the masterminds behind the scenes at today’s biggest festivals.</p><p>I’ve got this set to a killer soundtrack, so crank it up while you watch aerial footage of riggers in action, scaling heights and piecing together the stages where the magic happens. With a slick music visualizer woven in, this video gives you a front-row seat to the art and science of rigging—showing you how it all started and where it’s at now.</p><p>We’re talking centuries of skill, from ancient mariners to the folks who make sure the lights, sound, and stage are ready to rock. This is the craft that makes live entertainment come to life, but it’s always happening just out of view. So sit back, vibe with the music, and get a behind-the-scenes look at the people who rig the impossible, creating the foundations for every epic show.</p><p><br></p><p>Like, drop a comment, and hit that subscribe if you're into seeing more of the artistry behind the stage!</p><p><br></p><p>Photography by http://www.michaellegrand.com/</p>
