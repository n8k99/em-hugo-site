<p>This week has been a blisteringly productive and creative one. I directed a music video, collaborated with a talented singer, had an amazingly productive band rehearsal, wrote and record a four track EP to be release in the near future. So, this week's podcast episode is stripped down to bare bones, just me and a piano for half an hour of improvisational composition. Throw some eerie reverb and echo type effects on the whole thing and lay down and take a nap. </p><p>Seriously, it's music to dream by. Or about. Or for. </p><p>I head the story of how Keith Jarrett's "The Køln Concert (Live)" was made, which is different than listening to the album, and set out to make my own solo piano piece. Granted, I did not do it in front of a sold out Opera House, nor was I playing on a broken piano, but it was me and the keys discovering the tune as it flowed out of me. </p><p>Now, I will go listen to that album and enjoy the differences which span the initial conditions and fifty years. </p>
