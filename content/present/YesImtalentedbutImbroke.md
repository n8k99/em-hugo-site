<p>Once again, I have managed to create more new music. It's not so experimental, but also not very commercial. Still it is fun to make this music and to keep my creative juices flowing. There are so many things going on in the background of my life that are stressing me out but I really do enjoy making this new music whether or not it brings me any financial successes. </p>
