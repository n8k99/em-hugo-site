<p>For this week&apos;s exercise, I did not touch any musical instruments as physical interfaces with the sounds. Instead, every single note and beat of this music was written through mouse clicks (although it could also have been written with pen &amp; ink on a page) inside of my DAW. There is a very Trance like feel to the whole episode with its long periods of phrasing and gradual buildups. The Tension and Release cycle was intentionally dragged into a larger periodicity to allow the mind to drift within the environmental effects of harmonics developing across contrasting timbres and textures.Â </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
