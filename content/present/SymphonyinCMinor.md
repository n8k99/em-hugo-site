<p>The time it took to compose and produce this in my DAW was two weeks. The time it took to compose and produce this period was thirty years. It feels very satisfactory and amazing to have the sounds that have been in my head for so long finally audible for others to enjoy. If you have ever caught me 'noodling' on a piano tucked away in the the corner of some space, this is the stuff I have been working on. I have heard the strings and brass echoing in my head. I have felt the harmonies and dissonances resonant while stroking the keyboard. Now Finally, I have it down in a complete symphonic sound thanks to the BBC Symphonic Orchestra plug-in.</p>
