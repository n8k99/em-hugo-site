<p><strong>Episode 108: The Hope of a New System</strong></p><p>This week's episode is a new journey in a new direction, or an old direction revisited. I can not remember which way we've already been at this point. I have gotten a little frustrated with some perceived staleness on my part. Programming beats and bass lines and all the other parts note by note on the grid has felt more and more strangled. At least those are the words I will describe the feeling today. </p><p>That being said, they only person who can make me change my ways is myself. So this week's episode is performed in segments, one track at a time. When the track sounds good, I moved on to the next track, and began putting new wrinkles on the composition. I did this for each instrument. Throwing little mixing tricks to enhance each sound and texture until it felt strongly like a wildly epic journey. </p><p>This is not a dance track. This is not meant to groove to, this is meant to think to. To sit and feel to, perhaps to sit and drive to. It is definitely not a sleeping song, it is too full of peaks and valleys, ebbs and flows, tension and release to be a sleeping song.</p><p>This is also the start of a bunch of trumpet voicings. I am feeling pretty strongly lately about how I need to be playing more horn. Much more horn and worrying less and less about lyrics and vocals. I am quite happy with abstracts and the mathematics of removing the one for one communication that the vocabulary of narratives via vocals demands. </p><p>Sit back, relax and let the story unfold within your head. </p>
