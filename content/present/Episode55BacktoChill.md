<div>I have these soundscapes set up which is a great deal of fun to play through. Here&apos;s a half an hour of material which I came up with this week. <br/><br/>Also, I just released an album of Ambient Electronic Music on Bandcamp called <a href='https://n8k99.bandcamp.com/album/ambiant-discordant'>Ambient Discordant</a>, check it out and buy it because I can use the money! <br/><br/></div><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
