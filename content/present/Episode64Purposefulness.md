<p>Sitting down in the Creative Spaceship yesterday, with absolutely nothing written for this week&apos;s podcast, I had to force myself to go through and churn up ideas.  I took a stab at one idea that was based off of the sound of a drum machine and a basic pattern this lead me to my first track; &quot;Platinum Chill&quot;. From there the creativity was flowing and I mixed up another out of bit sounds called &quot;Pause Game&quot;. This started me on a pattern of alliteration and quickly &quot;Passing Lane&quot; and &quot;Pump that Energy up&quot; came pouring out of my DAW. A bit of world building jamming with instruments lead me to complete &quot;Planetary Progress&quot; and finally I put together a nice chill out finisher called &quot;Purpose.&quot; </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
