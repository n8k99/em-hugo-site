<p>Its very funny the way my listening habits go into the ideas which get explored. I have been rehearsing some DJ mixes and listening to several different genres of EDM. All this week I have also been doing some woodworking projects; laying a new parquet floor and building a cabinet for my musical gear. So while doing this work, I&apos;m listening to a bunch of Tech House, 140 Dub, DnB and such. <br/><br/>Then I realized that I have yet to compose this week&apos;s podcast. So I started just dropping beats and throwing key signatures around. And suddenly, I have my take on Tech House.  Surprise!<br/><br/>Well, Enjoy!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
