<p>If you want Peace, then you must realize that it comes from within.  There are hard choices which come with this path; letting go of distractions, cutting people out of your life who are not supportive in the manner which helps you grow, and giving up the option of having a wild and active life pursuing the next big thing. Peace is a spiritual journey with embodies letting go of conflicts. Only when you can find the peace within yourself can you put peace out into the world. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
