<p>Just pretending to make up my own genre of electronic music. I&apos;ve thrown together Two Step drum and bass rhythms with Latin feel keyboards and synths. Mixing in some vocal chants and boom! My own invention. <br/><br/>Also, I just released an album of Ambient Electronic Music on Bandcamp called <a href='https://n8k99.bandcamp.com/album/ambiant-discordant'>Ambient Discordant</a>, check it out and buy it because I can use the money!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
