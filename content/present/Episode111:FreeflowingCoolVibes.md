<p>I have an idea. Its a simple idea, its sort of a rehash of the direction I was moving in a year ago, or eighteen months ago (its sort of nebulous my connection between time space and concepts). The general idea is setting up my gear so that I can free flow through numerous different soundscapes. There will be a progression of intensity and tempos as I go. The big part is to be able to play a four hour long set of these ideas which are off the cuff improvisations based upon the vibve of the environment. </p><p>But what sort of environment?</p><p>I see this being outdoors venues like biergartens or patios of restaurants, even one day on a festival stage. Someplace where there is a connection with nature; sun, moonlight, wind, even rain. And I will feed off the natural vibes, the energy of the crowd and lead us all through moods and emotions with sound. </p><p>All that being said, I have begun the intensive programming of my gear which is required to complete such an event. And testing out the programming for about a half an hour of solid playing is what this week's episode is about. Thus I present: <strong>Free Flowing Cool Vibes.</strong></p>
