<p>Right then.</p><p>This week has been a bundle of activity. I am working on a new cabinet for the gear to ride around town in. I am also working on getting neat little places in town to play. Plus, in preparation for this month's Beats &amp; Brews, I started a brand new Main Stage 3 Concert file. The first half hour of this file is exactly what I recorded for this week's episode.</p><p>There are no track names, nor any actual tracks, it is just passing the journey from one soundscape to the next. I have been playing around with this theme for decades and it has grown and evolved over the years and I am really getting into the process of twisitng it up into new and different shapes and textures. </p>
