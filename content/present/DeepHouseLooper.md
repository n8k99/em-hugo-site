<p>In this episode, I delve into two distinct modes of <em>Logic Pro X</em>. While I’m highly experienced with the traditional track editor mode—where I typically stack numerous tracks to build layers of depth—I recently decided to explore a new territory: the live looper mode. Though this approach was initially a bit outside my comfort zone, I took the plunge one evening to figure out how to harness its potential.</p><p>I started by creating a collection of drum loops, bass lines, and synth melodies, then experimented with shifting them from cell to cell, dynamically recording the changes as part of my loop stacks. This new workflow is opening up fresh creative directions, allowing me to discover new techniques and push my boundaries.</p><p>The result of this exploration is this week’s <em>Deep House Looper</em>—a reflection of this exciting, innovative journey. I hope you enjoy the ride as much as I did in creating it.</p>
