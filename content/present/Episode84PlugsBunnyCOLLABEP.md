<p>What an amazing and exciting day in the studio this was. Plugs Bunny and TaiLee333 rolled up in and jumped right into conversations with me. We were all over philosophy and outer space and inner space and so much more in between. Then w3 started with absolutely blank files and built six tracks of amazingly fun, weird and awesome versions of Hip Hop. This collaboration series is really taking off in ways that I had never imagined.Â </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
