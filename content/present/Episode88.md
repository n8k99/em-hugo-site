<p>This Episode was recorded in the time window between 31 December and 2 January. The first track End of Days is a Trip Hop/Ambient composition made in the morning, also the last song of last year. Then starting with Ionian Columns, I begin inventing a hybrid between improvisational jazz compositions and DnB tempo pushes. Furiously Falling Forward and Bartender Calls continued this evolution where I used some production techniques to take the composition into an area where my physical abilities were exceeded. For the final track, Ballistic Blues, i really dove into this technique of playing the song extremely slowly while recording and then speeding it up much faster during the mixing process. All in all, the results get progressively funkier and funkier.</p><p>One thing I realized in this session. I can play the drums, I’m just really slow!</p><p>🎉 New Patreon Exclusive! 🎉</p><p>🌟 Dive into the Sonic Journey of &apos;Living Room Music by N8K99&apos; 🎵</p><p>🎶 Episode Highlight: &quot;The New Year&apos;s Sonic Evolution&quot; 🚀</p><p>📅 Recorded: Dec 31 - Jan 2</p><p>🌄 First Track: &quot;End of Days&quot; - A morning&apos;s creation blending Trip Hop &amp; Ambient vibes, bidding farewell to the last year.</p><p>🎼 The Evolution:</p><p>1️⃣ &quot;Ionian Columns&quot; - The start of an experimental fusion of improvisational jazz &amp; DnB tempos.</p><p>2️⃣ &quot;Furiously Falling Forward&quot; &amp; &quot;Bartender Calls&quot; - Pushing boundaries with advanced production techniques, exploring beyond my physical limits.</p><p>3️⃣ &quot;Ballistic Blues&quot; - A unique experiment in recording slow, then speeding up during mixing, resulting in a funky, fast-paced final track.</p><p>🥁 Fun Fact: Turns out, I can play the drums... just at a slower tempo! 🐢➡️🚀</p><p>🎧 Patreon Perks:</p><p>✨ Early Access to episodes</p><p>👉 Join us on this musical odyssey and unlock your access to these unique sounds and stories!
