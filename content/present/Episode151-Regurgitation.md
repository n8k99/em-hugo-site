<p>Throwing out the "old school" or more traditional musical conventions, which often emphasize melody, established patterns, and harmony, I am embracing a bold new direction focused on experimentation with sound manipulation. This shift is not merely a rejection of the past; rather, it acts as a springboard, utilizing my own previous creations as foundational building blocks—elements that inform my current explorations and inspire innovative approaches. With this methodology, I aim to uncover a new and refreshing way to craft sound into a captivating narrative that envelops the listener. </p><p>The essence of my work is to deliberately warp perceptions, effectively challenging listeners to question their understanding of music and sound. I engage in a playful deconstruction of the musical aspects typically associated with sonic narratives. For instance, rather than relying on traditional chord progressions or predictable rhythms, I experiment with unexpected sonic textures and unconventional sound sources. By layering recordings of everyday objects or manipulating digital samples, I create a tapestry of sound that invites exploration and curiosity. This approach not only reinvents the listener's experience but also broadens the conceptual boundaries of what music can be, encouraging a deeper engagement with sound as a form of storytelling.</p><p><br></p><p>Incorporating some vintage text-to-speech segments, I am embracing a creative endeavor where I infuse these segments with an abundance of bizarre effects and intricate engineering techniques. This approach is not merely about rehashing existing narratives; rather, it serves as a unique opportunity to reconstruct stories that have been explored in the past from fresh, innovative angles. For instance, by altering pitch, adding echoes, and employing unexpected soundscapes, I aim to transform familiar voices into haunting echoes or whimsical figures that challenge the listener’s perceptions. </p><p><br></p><p>My goal is fundamentally rooted in the desire to shed new light on the processes involved in narrative construction as well as the narratives themselves. By manipulating the auditory landscape, I can highlight the emotional undercurrents or absurdities that may have gone unnoticed in their original forms. This is akin to seeing a painting under different lighting—elements that were once subtle may now stand out vibrantly, offering audiences a chance to engage with content that they thought they understood. Through this playful yet thoughtful reengineering of sound, I hope to invite listeners not only to reconsider what they know but also to explore the myriad possibilities of storytelling that emerge when we allow creativity to take the lead.</p>
