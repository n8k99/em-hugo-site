<p>This might be the last. I’ve let things slip — allowed my focus to wander toward other ambitions, though I’m not sure any of them mean more than distraction. Lately, I’ve been circling the idea of a spoken-word project called _The 13 Towers of Orbis_, but honestly, I may never press record. I’ve spent far too much time crafting lore and history for it — more time than the thing probably deserves. Most of what I’ve written feels like it’s already unraveling. Full of contradictions, gaps, things I no longer believe. Like me. And maybe that’s the problem — we can’t both fall apart.</p><p>Still, I’ve been working. Building a world, maybe even a universe, piece by piece. And while doing so, I’ve buried myself in learning new tools — ways to organize, visualize, archive, pretend it all adds up to something. Then, somehow this week, I landed on the concept of data sonification — something NASA once explored. I fed my vault of notes into it, just to hear what they’d sound like. Noise, structure, whatever. I needed to hear _something_. And maybe that’s why Episode 150 will be this — not a song, not a set, but a kind of ghost signal from the archive. A last note, or maybe a new kind of silence.</p>
