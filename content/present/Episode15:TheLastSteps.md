<p>Yesterday morning, I had a follow up medical appointment for an injury sustained at work a month ago. The MRI results show that there are several torn tissues in my right shoulder. I have been referred to a surgeon. This means my job of lifting heavy things and hanging them high in the air is on a stand still. I spent the afternoon wallowing in some emotions on the couch and went to bed early. I woke up this morning and remembered that I did not publish a podcast episode this week. So without further delay here are the songs of emotions for this week:<br/><br/>* Grief<br/>* Serenity<br/>* Surprise<br/>* Annoyance<br/>* Admiration<br/>* Disgust</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
