<p>It&apos;s very buzzy this term AI. It&apos;s very buzzy because a Science Fiction concept is being manifested into reality. It has been utilized by the writers of these fiction stories as plot device and the evil which creates conflict in the narrative. Therefore, it is preloaded with fears and misconceptions thus wild speculation and fears are running rampant within the population. Naturally, the applications of this new technology are still being worked out and like all new technology, we have no actual idea how its going to affect society at large. This uncertainty and inability to know what is coming along because of it leaves plenty of room for fear mongers to stoke the fires within the hearts of those who easily succumb to dystopian nightmares. Therefore, I have a theme for this week&apos;s episode.</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
