<p>This idea came to me a few weeks ago, and I have been slowly introducing it into my laboratory experiments. It is by no means finished its evolution. This is just a way station along the path.<br/><br/>I have a keyboard which has some sounds that include beats programmed within them. For the past year or so, I have been tweaking these sounds to match my personal preferences and this has been the large part of what I have been presenting own a weekly basis. I also possess an electronic drum kit which sends out MIDI signals. The idea of using the e-drums as triggers for sliced up samples at the same time as the drum sounds are generated is what I have started playing with. Using this concept simultaneously with the keyboard is the big directional shift that is starting to develop. <br/><br/>I can see another layer or two of sound generation coming along in the future and I am excited by this journey. There will be rocky episodes but I think that this will only get tighter and more intensely layered as time progresses. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
