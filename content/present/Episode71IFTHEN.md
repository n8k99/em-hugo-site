<p>IF{collab(N8K99, spiritus ex machina)} THEN{generate(IDM, Jungle, Jazztronica)};<br/><br/>What that means in English, is that fellow electronic music artist,<b> Spiritus Ex Machina, </b> came out to my Sunday night jam and collaborated with me. We recorded the first hour to listen to on pla=yback. We both agreed it was Fire and therefore more people needed to hear it. Thus it has become this week&apos;s podcast episode. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
