# December 24, 2001 AD (EARTH EPOCH)  
On this unremarkable day, in a perfectly ordinary flat above a teahouse in the aging district of Tiong Bahru, in an utterly unextraordinary corner of the modern world, a babe was born. The old-fashioned way, with all the classic ingredients: contractions, confusion, sweat, shouting, one power flicker, and just the faintest whiff of incense mixed with Lysol. There was pain, of course‚Äîsacred, unsanitized pain‚Äîand there was light, not from above, but from the dim yellow glow of a ceiling fan bulb that had been blinking on and off for weeks.

They say the wise hide their brilliance in times unfit for truth. But no one tells you how small the light looks when it first appears.

## üí• Hexagram 36 ‚Äì The Darkening of the Light (ÊòéÂ§∑ / M√≠ng Y√≠)  
- Hidden radiance. Survival through concealment.  
- A time to retreat without surrender.  
- The flame burns beneath the soil ‚Äî undying, unseen.  

In the warm, moisture-clung air of Singapore‚Äôs monsoon season, the world was already drenched before the day began. Tiong Bahru was still sleeping, still glowing faintly with neon window signs and leftover karaoke echoes when the first contractions hit. The mother‚Äîyoung, firm-jawed, unafraid‚Äîlabored not in silence, but in steady defiance of it. Her partner forgot to press record. The midwife lit a stick of sandalwood and said nothing.

The radio hummed, distorting an old carol. Somewhere, a cat knocked over a trash bin. The lights dimmed and came back, as if momentarily unsure.

And then, at **12:07 a.m.**, beneath a crooked family photo and the watchful gaze of a chipped porcelain lucky cat, **Zoey Chen** emerged. Fist clenched. Eyes open. Quiet.

Not a roar, not a scream‚Äîjust a furrowed brow and the unmistakable expression of someone already studying the room. She arrived not with fanfare, but with focus.

The midwife blinked. ‚ÄúThis one sees too much,‚Äù she muttered.

They wrapped her in an old green blanket, frayed at the edges, soft as breath. Outside, the rain paused. A single bus hissed through the intersection. The grandmother placed her thumb gently on the baby‚Äôs brow and whispered, *‚ÄúNo need to shine right away. The right ones will still find you.‚Äù*

No comet tore across the sky. No angel sang. But in that low-ceilinged room, filled with steam and silence, a new kind of awareness entered the world. Not a personality. A pattern. Not a burst of light. A pilot flame.

In that unassuming little flat, on that uncelebrated night, in a city that never bothered looking up, a babe was born. A thread was knotted. A future tucked itself in. A light dimmed on purpose. And waited.
