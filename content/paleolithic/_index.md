# A Long, Long Time Ago...

In this very galaxy, a young adventurous bard set out to find what ever he could find. One of the first things that happened in the beginning of this new quest was it was pressed upon him, by a kind figure, to put everything that happens down by pen on paper. And this is exactly what he did.

Over the decades, the many situations and scenarios found their way into **The Ritual of Morning Pages**. These early meditations captured in many tomes, could possibly now be considered a Library. It is in the early years of adventuring which specifically lead our young bard to the place we are now. Therefore, we find it imperative to begin a process of capturing the essence of these ink bound scratching, in an attempt to decipher his mind.

## The Ritual of Morning Pages
Upon awakening, before doing anything else, with pen write three pages of whatever comes to mind. These pages are best bound within a blank journal designated for this type of task. There is an entire cottage industry associated with the production of these books. They range from simple bound notebooks to elaborate leather covers with embossed designs and brilliant edge artwork on the stack of pages. Our young bard, is about to go on a journey of discovery which involves figuring out which book is the correct one for the chapter he is in.

Far beyond just the book, there is also the question of which impliment to use for transferring ink to the page. Of course, the best pen is the one in your hand, however sometimes you just need to have a special plume for transcribing these thoughts. The instrument selected just might elevate the words from being merely *taking out the garbage of the mind* into something loftier and bordering upon artistry. You never can tell what results will come out of this magical inscribing wand.

And this gets us to the final element of the ritual. Letting go of judgement. Sure when it is put into simple terminology like that, it sounds really easy. However, as many practioners of various spiritual faiths will attest, simple is much more difficult to achieve than complications. And letting go of judgement is not so much an instruction as it is an ideal towareds which to aim oneself much like an arrow notched upon a bow. The best result is once the intention is set, and the string released, just watch its flight passively until gravity and the target cause it to cease. And if you did not hit the bullseye this morning, there is always tomorrow. But this is where the metaphor breaks because within **The Ritual of Morning Pages** there is no target to hit. 

The hand moving across the page leaving a trail of its journey is the purpose of these accounts. When the hand has completed its three pages, then it is time to start the day. 

## Long Term Results
The first benefit of this practice is self-discipline and mastery over the mind. Giving yourself permission to practice this bit of introspection on a daily basis with any high level of consistency establishes a great amount of self-respect in that you do not start off the morning succumbing to the demands of the world. Rather what you do is build an interior landscape which maps out the corners of your own character. Additionally, keeping this practice over years and years develops a facility of constructing your thoughts into long form expressions just because you have been exercising the creative parts of the brain much the way an elite athlete puts in the repetitions to perfect a free throw. 

Finally, dedicating this little portion of the day towards **The Ritual of Morning Pages** allows one to observe patterns in behavior. These may be patterns in others, mbut most likely they will be observed within oneself. This can be painful when you find yourself writing the same lamentations over and over and over again, and then vowing never to repeat that set of decisions, but once again find yourself passing your hand through the same patterns of thinking and actions within the world. This pain is can in fact serve as a catalyst for true growth and development, for you will be aware of the repeating pattern within your life and may in fact find the inner resolve to steer through the situation in a different manner and thus avoiding the inevitable painful outcome which you had been through many times before.

## Discovery through Experience
Our young bard, who was poised upon this vast journey had no idea of the potential results. While he had indeed read about some of these benefits as well as the instructions of how to follow this practice. He was one who had to *experience these lessons* in order to learn them. Perhaps you are made differently than he was, and can learn for his experiences what to do and what not to do. And if this is the case, then you deserve all manner of salutes and prestige.
