# May 20, 1970 AD(EARTH EPOCH) 
On this inauspicious day, in an inauspicious little burg, in an, not to be too redundant, inauspicious part of the world; a babe was born. The old fashioned way, lots of pushing, screaming, blood, guts, and a scream of victory. Or defeat. It all depends upon your perspective I guess, if you are the tunnel or the one pushing through towards the light.

In the dim, flickering light of a single, sputtering candle, the small, weather-beaten town of ~~Eldergrove~~ lay shrouded in a thick, oppressive fog. The air was heavy with the scent of rain-soaked earth and the distant, mournful cries of night creatures echoing through the dense, ancient woods that bordered the town. It was a place forgotten by time, where the cobblestone streets whispered tales of bygone eras and the crumbling facades of the buildings stood as silent sentinels to the passage of centuries.

On this particular day, a day marked by an ominous alignment of the stars, the town seemed to hold its breath in anticipation. The sky, a swirling tapestry of storm clouds, loomed overhead like a brooding giant, casting an eerie pallor over the landscape. It was as if the universe itself had conspired to create the perfect backdrop for the momentous event that was about to unfold.

In a modest, ivy-clad cottage nestled at the edge of town, a woman labored in the throes of childbirth. Her cries pierced the stillness of the night, a primal symphony of pain and determination that resonated through the very bones of the earth. The room was a cacophony of sound and motion, the midwife's urgent commands mingling with the woman's gasps and the rhythmic creaking of the old wooden floorboards.

The air was thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy scent of sweat, a testament to the raw, untamed power of life itself. The woman's face, contorted with effort, glistened with perspiration, her eyes alight with a fierce, unyielding resolve. She was a warrior in the throes of battle, her body a vessel of creation, straining against the confines of flesh and bone to bring forth new life.

With one final, triumphant scream, a sound that seemed to reverberate through the very fabric of the universe, the child emerged into the world. The room fell silent, the air charged with a palpable sense of awe and wonder. The midwife, her hands steady and sure, cradled the newborn in her arms, her eyes wide with a mixture of reverence and disbelief.

The child, a tiny, wriggling bundle of pure potential, let out a lusty wail, a sound that seemed to echo through the ages. It was a cry of defiance, a declaration of existence, a testament to the indomitable force of life itself. In that moment, the world seemed to shift on its axis, the very air crackling with the electric thrill of possibility.

As the mother gazed upon her child, her heart swelled with a fierce, protective love. She saw in those tiny features the promise of a future yet unwritten, a story waiting to be told. The child was a blank canvas, a vessel of infinite potential, a living embodiment of the cosmic dance of creation and destruction.

In the quiet aftermath of the birth, as the storm clouds began to dissipate and the first rays of dawn broke over the horizon, the town of Eldergrove stirred to life. The townsfolk, drawn by the primal call of new beginnings, gathered in hushed reverence, their faces alight with a mixture of curiosity and hope.

For in that inauspicious little burg, on that inauspicious day, in an inauspicious part of the inauspicious world, a babe was born. A child of destiny, a beacon of light in a world shrouded in shadow. A force of inception, an unstoppable momentum, a cosmic ignition. Not merely a personality, but a principle. A source event. An ending that was, in truth, a new beginning.
