<p>I used a random chord progression generator to create 16 different chord progressions. Sort of like rolling musical dice. Then I assembled sixteen different sound palettes to play through them. Then, for 33 minutes, I pushed buttons to change from palette to palette using this chord changes to improvise. Well it wasn&apos;t necessarily 33 minutes because I defined the amount of time, that&apos;s just how long it took me to go through these changes. <br/><br/>I like this as a segment for development of future songs. I will refine some of the palettes and some of the beats. There will be more melodic stuff which happens over time as my right shoulder recovers from surgery. <br/><br/>Also. Today my double album is live.<br/>Chromatic Depression: Volume One https://recordu.lnk.to/cdv1<br/>Chromatic Depression: Volume Two https://recordu.lnk.to/cdv2<br/><br/>You can find it in these locations.  </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
