<p>Setting myself up for another live show next Thursday night. I am planning on having a drummer and a bass player come out to jam along with me. I have been experimenting with letting another person play guitar in the past but I think that experiment has run its course. So I will be handling the guitar and it is linked up with the synthesizers so that both are playing simultaneously. Therefore, this week&apos;s episode was a little improvisation in one take following these soundscape patterns I&apos;ve programmed. <br/><br/>One of the things I have shifted this week is energy direction. Taking out the big kick and snare combo lets the music breathe. I am hoping that playing with a human drummer next week will retain some of this chill as we build and connect together. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
