<p>Twenty-five or thirty years ago, in Jacksonville, there was a punk rock band called The Beefpimps. The lineup included L10 on bass, Keller on drums, Swine as the lead vocalist and I was honored to be the guitar player. This is a tale of the 90s so it is full of all the old references to all the old things we were into back then. Everyone has moved on, grown up or older and gotten on with their lives but it was a brilliantly fun moment in time. I occasionally revisit some of those songs, in part or parcel. However this past week, L10 came over and suggested we put down one of his songs from that band. The lead me to dig around in my brain to set down more charts.<br/><br/>So in line with L10&apos;s idea, we recorded &quot;Everybody Hates Me.&quot; Then I began doing the new things and playing with the mix and made a segment I call &quot;Too Cool for Punk Rock.&quot; I dusted off the &quot;Lonely&quot; song and then pulled its carcass into the electronica machine to make &quot;Moonbeams and Starlight&quot; as well as another spin off called &quot;Once Upon a Time.&quot; Finally we get to the band&apos;s theme song, &quot;Beefpimps.&quot;Â  As I was/am a huge fan of the work of Jello Biafra and the Dead Kennedys, I composed a rant song called &quot;C.R.A.P. &amp; Shit.&quot; Then to close out the half hour, I pulled out a song called &quot;She loves to give...&quot;<br/><br/>As always, I hope you enjoy listening half as much as I enjoy making this.<br/><br/></p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
