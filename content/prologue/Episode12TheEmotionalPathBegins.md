<p>As I previously discussed, I have had an idea of superimposing the Circle of Fifths onto the Wheel of Emotions and writing music that navigates both simultaneously. Currently, this is filed under the name <b>527 Project.<br/><br/></b>On 27 May 02022, from ten o&apos;clock to midnight, I will be performing this two hour song cycle at Justice Pub, in downtown Jacksonville, Florida.  <br/><br/>This week&apos;s episode is a sneak peak at the first half hour. This includes six songs.<br/><br/>     * Joy<br/>      * Distraction<br/>      * Anticipation<br/>      * Fear<br/>       * Loathing<br/>       * Trust<br/><br/>Each song is 4:48 long and has plenty of space for improvisation during the live set yet I also believe that they can stand alone as they are. Enjoy!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
