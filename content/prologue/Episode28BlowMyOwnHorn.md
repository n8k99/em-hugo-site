<p>This podcast is beginning to shape up as a valuable tool for experimentation. It is also starting to yield results. This week I am playing around with using my trumpet to trigger MIDI signals within the keyboard station. There are programmed beats which I shift between and progress through as the trumpet is sending signals to the play chords and baselines based off of programmed patterns. I&apos;m really happy with the way this is getting a jazz + electronica sound. <br/><br/>Plug for my Double Album &quot;Chromatic Depression: Volume One &amp; Two &quot;<br/>https://recordu.lnk.to/cdv1<br/>https://recordu.lnk.to/cdv2</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
