#  When is an Enterprise begun?
Is it started when the idea first blooms within a mind? Does it begin when additional thoughts are invested into the idea? Or is it possible that an Enterprise is not actually considered such until it has a sequence of actions associated with manifesting it into reality. Philosophically, there is valid perspectives on all these questions, some of which are highly or maybe just slightly contradictory with the other perspectives. However for the sake of argument, in the sense of Logic and not merely obstreperousness, we are going to consider the roots of Enterprise being the initial sequence of events which predate its existence as a manifested entity. 

Therefore, as "the past is prologue," we will examine the immediate sequence of events which lead to the creation of Eckenrode Muziekopname as a fictional entity known as a corporation, even if that corporate status is fictional itself. [_**NOTE:** This is a sidebar argument to pursue which will have some creative imaginings that broach Legalities._] 

Do we expect that there will be any definitive answers to these _big questions?_ The response to this sort of open-ended query could very well be smugly stated in one word: **Maybe**. However, as we are not in this game to be coy or even sarcastically witty, rather we are in hot pursuit of something much bigger and much more important than mere glib speculation. So the answer we will have to live with at the immediate moment is, **"More will be Revealed.""**
