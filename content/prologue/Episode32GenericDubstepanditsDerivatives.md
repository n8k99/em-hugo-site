<p>Continuing to mine this new vein of creativity, I submit another week&apos;s episode which is dedicated to mathematically based breakdowns of generically created dubstep tracks. My process is to create the Generic Dubstep tracks out of Apple Loops within the Dubstep category. Then convert the finished track into Drum Machine MIDI tracks and produce two more tracks based off this process. Finally, I mix them together to make this half hour long journey through the sonic landscape.</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
