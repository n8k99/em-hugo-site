<p>So, here in the Living Room, I have all the musical gear I could possibly desire. Wait. Who am I kidding? I always want more gear! But anyways. I have microphones which I have put to good use so far for trumpet and didgeridoo segments. This episode I am concentrating on vocals. I also have a lovely little plugin which lets me write vocals for robot voices to sing for me. So I did some experimenting with this as well.<br/><br/><br/></p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
