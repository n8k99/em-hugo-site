<p>Just for fun this week and warm-up, I started making pretty generic dubstep tracks using loops. It&apos;s fun. It&apos;s creative. It&apos;s not ground breaking or earth moving- well beyond the deep bass rumbles and stuff like that. Then I took that single track and turned it into drumheads in a sampler, arranged them in pretty patterns, added some effects and washed it out. Then repeated that whole second step again. Finally, I took my DJ software and mixed them all together like a generic EDM DJ. And Voila! That is this week&apos;s episode.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
