<p>Lately, I have been concentrating on turning some outlines and frameworks into tracks. These are dabbles in genres which range from Chillwave to Drum n Bass. Once I have formatted the song outline, I then add lead parts on the keys or other instruments. This is a blending of jazz elements with EDM which is an expression of my internal landscape. <br/><br/>I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll write much more about it now. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
