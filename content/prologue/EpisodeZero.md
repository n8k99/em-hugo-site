<p>Originally, this was starting out as a set list of beats to improvise a performance. However, I got deeper into the creative process it took on a life of its own. Now, a new plan has emerged. I will be live-streaming the creative process, including friends who come along for the ride, then editing YouTube videos as brief documentation of the process, and finally the end result will be a podcast setlist of Electronic Music. Naturally, from the podcast, I will break out individual tracks and upload them to a Bandcamp page.&nbsp;</p><p>Track List</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* People of the Earth</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Soul Vampire</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Strangely Attractive</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* These Things</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Creep by Radiohead</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Last Chance to be a Rockstar</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;* Extra Time</p><p><br></p><p>With the exception of of Creep, all Tracks written, produced and performed by N8K99. eIsQ9IHaYz5DSsX1Zss6</p><p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Support the show</a></p>
