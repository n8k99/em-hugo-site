<p>As I have been experimenting in my laboratory, fiddling with settings, set ups and wirings, I continually play some cover songs. Just to test out the equipment and whatnot. Thus this week&apos;s episode contains a pair of cover songs, &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; by Prince and &quot;Creep&quot; by Radiohead. These were recorded in single takes, where all the sounds were performed sequentially as if I were actually a competent musician and all that. Then just to plump out the duration of the episode, a Trance song I wrote yesterday called &quot;4 U Babe&quot; was slipped in between them. I hope y&apos;all enjoy my weirdness!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
