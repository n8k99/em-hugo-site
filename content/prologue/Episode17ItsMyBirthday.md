<p>This week is a really fun result in my laboratory. I&apos;ve been diving into instruction manuals to learn as much as I can about all the gear that has been collecting in my studio. So I put some of that to practice to dash off a nice little improvised bit. There are no names and no tracks to delineate but its an epsiode when I was listening to check the mastering levels, I ran it six times in a row. So its likely my favorite one yet.<br/><br/></p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
