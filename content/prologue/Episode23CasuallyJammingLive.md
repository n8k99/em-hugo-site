<p>This week is a presentation of some genuinely weird music. Some of which I really don&apos;t know how to explain. Mostly because it is the very beginning of s a new recipe. There are contributions by Niki Wolf, L10, and Fiverr Stereo but I couldn&apos;t tell you what are where they contributed. This was an all live, just go with what we got effort and it turned out some interesting parts. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
