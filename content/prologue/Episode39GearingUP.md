<p>Last Saturday, I was rehearsing my set of music and I decided that none of it was any good for what I wanted to present. So, I started a blitz of creativity and created an entirely new Three Hour long set for last night&apos;s performance. All that work pushed away the time needed to give this week&apos;s episode it&apos;s own identity, so I recorded the first half hour of changes from that show&apos;s playlist to fill in this week.<br/><br/>As I am sitting in my studio now, with all my gear scattered from last night&apos;s logistics, I will work out the video for publication tomorrow. <br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/></p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
