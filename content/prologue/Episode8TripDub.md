<p>Sometimes in the Living Room, these episodes start out in one direction and then midway through, I get struck with an idea that is really intriguing and absolutely must be attempted. That is exactly what has happened here. The idea involves my old friend and mathematical concept, fractals. Using a visual reference to lay out thirteen different sound patterns in such a way that there is some reputation of patterns but also there is progressive advancement into new flow. Additionally, I have employed multiple threads of sidechaining these channels together so that there is a controlled chaos to the whole endeavor. Finally, I have repeated large patterns, whilst making detailed changes within them to provide a really broad strokes experience of transcended dub designed to trip the mind.</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
