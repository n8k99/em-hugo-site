<p>This week, I have been really busy in my woodshop crafting a new keyboard station. I believe it turned out quite exceptionally. The byproduct of this activity is that my studio gear was not connected again until this morning. Rather than rush through a new composition sequence, I dusted off some tracks out of my archives. Some of these songs were written at the beginning of Lockdown, which is when I feel that my foot once again solidly landed on this path. There is at least one song that has been following me around since the early 90s and has just never really found a home to fit into. Sort of like me. Well, now, I think, both of us have a pretty good home.Â <br/><br/>The track names are as follows:<br/>Â  Â  Â Peaceful Ride<br/>Â  Â  Break From Outer Space<br/>Â  Â  Orbital Existentialism<br/>Â  Â  Shoulder Drop Chill<br/>Â  Â  Lyin&apos; to Myself<br/>Â  Â  Without You<br/><br/>Check out my Double Album:<br/>Chromatic Depression: Volume One https://recordu.lnk.to/cdv1Â <br/>Chromatic Depression: Volume Two https://recordu.lnk.to/cdv2<br/><br/>Thank you all!</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
