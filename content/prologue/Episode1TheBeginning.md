<p>We are calling this the first episode because last week&apos;s episode just evolved and this week was the first time it was intentionally created as a podcast. The opening track is called<em> Zombie Robots don&apos;t Surf</em> and it features <b>L10</b> on the punk rock guitar. My old friend&apos;s very capable stylistics leads the cyberpunk aggression into snide commentary about corporate digital culture and its impact upon human level existence.  At the six minute mark, a new track called <em>Wounded Knee</em> is build on the beat crafted by <b>Phunkmonk. </b>The LoFi Beats and Jazzy feel allows for my highly processed trumpet solo to occupy a really chill space. Twelve minutes into the episode, I pick up a personal challenge; composing Techno House music for the instruments of the symphony. This segment is titled <em> Orchestral Movement in G minor.</em> Eighteen minutes into this study in contrasts, I have crafted a study in loops, overlapping variously timed segments to continue some of the energetic drive of the symphonic piece yet yielding the tonality to electronics and heavy effects. <em>Tears Falling</em> serves as the title as the deep effects are generated through the reading of a poem about crying.  and <em>Finally</em>, is another collaborative effort. the fabulous <b>Mr. Cott</b> crafts a fairly funky baseline to hang the rest of the song around, including space for me to improvise a melody on the guitar. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
