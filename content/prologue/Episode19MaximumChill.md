<p>Contining my efforts to experiment with features within my available hardware, I present this week&apos;s episode. A study in A minor. There are three instruments on this track: a keyboard Synthesizer, Bass Guitar, and Electric Guitar. All three have multiple sound layers which I manipulate through physical motions as well as electronic manipulations to produce the sounds you hear. I hope you enjoy.Â </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
