<p>Sometimes, creativity grows best in a bit of chaos. This week&apos;s episode is an exercise in controlled chaos. As this podcast is serving as a bit of a laboratory it seems fitting to throw out some conventions and go with really different ideas about music. <br/><br/>This essential concept with is being explored here is the electronic synergy between multiple channels and instruments. The conduit through with much of this is passing is called Sidechains. This is where the electronic signal from one channel is triggered and filtered by the electronic signal in another channel. There are multiple ways in which this can be set up. I have an couple of instances where one channel feeds another which feeds another which feeds another. There are also some places where I employ converging branches of side chains which finally result in a single trunk of sound.<br/><br/>The first nine minutes of this week&apos;s episode was created by myself and Mr. Cott. I played guitar and Mitch was on the bass and then the drums and later I added in some synth lines. The remainder of the time was the result of three different jam sessions in an afternoon between myself on drums and L10 on guitar that was MIDI loaded with synth sounds.<br/><br/>Ultimately, to really characterize the episode, I read half an hour&apos;s worth of poetry that came from the book I published several years back. And this is the new leaf which is beginning to sprout, particularly as there are great metaphors about trees which sprout up all over the poetic syllables.  </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
