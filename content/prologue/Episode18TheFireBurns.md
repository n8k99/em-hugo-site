<p>So, last week, I had this big two hour long show I was preparing for, however there was a serious technical issue. Less than a week before the show, my laptop battery died. It spent five days in the shop getting replaced. This meant that I was unable to work on my setlist or the podcast. I got the laptop out of the shop with 24 hours to go before the show at Justice Pub. In that time, I recorded and bounced down this episode AND finished throwing new patch changes into my setlist. (I did not have time to test out the patches soooooo the show we really super loud and required some on the fly editing.) In all the hustle and bustle of that time period and the holiday weekend and the whole rest of everything including a surprise pop up show last night - I totally blanked out on uploading the episode.<br/><br/>Oops. <br/><br/>Well, here it is. A half hour of improvised electronica.</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
