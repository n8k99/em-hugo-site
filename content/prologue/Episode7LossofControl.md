<p>I&apos;ve been preparing for a Live Show that is quickly approaching. I am scared, nervous and anxious about being able to perform my material solo. And yet, I still want to rise to my personal challenge of writing new music every week for this podcast. It is really thrilling to live this life. So while I had an idea to make a nice little jazz based episode, but the computers took over. <br/><br/>There&apos;s a trip through Future Bass, Chillwave and Bass House before I regain control over the episode and bring the jazz back. The finale for this week is a song called &quot;Futurismo Cowboys&quot; written by myself and L10 yesterday. </p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
