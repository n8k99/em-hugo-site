<p>All along, I have been fearful of being repetitive. All musicians have their favorite expressions, favorite finger movements, and favorite keys. There are songs which have been knocking around in my head for years, and perhaps because I have never recorded and released them before they have just taken up space. Perhaps, I need not be afraid of repetition, instead I should embrace the purge of old ideas and look forward to the flow of new expressions.<br/><br/>I start this week&apos;s episode off with some familiar to me chordal progressions but at the halfway point I really get into the process of evolving and progressing ideas. I do not fully believe that my musicality is completely lit at the moment but I can see the spark in the dark where it is about to really bloom. <br/><br/>Tracks list:<br/>      * These Things (with vocals) 0:00<br/>      * I want to say 3:44<br/>      * No Need for Fighting 9:09<br/>      * Protest the Protests 14:11<br/>      * Journey to the End of Continuum 17:31</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
