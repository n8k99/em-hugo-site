<p>Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart, as well as many of the other great composers in the Western Musical Traditions, pretty regularly created compositions of the form &quot;Theme and Variations.&quot; Often times, the main theme was a folk song or a melody that was popular. Then they crafted variations in the accompaniment, the melodic form and so on. The entire piece was longer than the snippet of the theme as it had originally been.<br/>Thus, this week&apos;s episode I have taken a popular and well-recognized theme and crafted variations. We go through some cinematic electronica, Deep House, Hardstyle, Dubstep, and Drum n Bass all while riffing on this theme.Â <br/>If you don&apos;t recognize this theme, it is undercover. As an aside, the title of this week&apos;s episode comes from my favorite scene in &quot;Skyfall.&quot;</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
