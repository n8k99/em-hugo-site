<p>Working towards an idea where all my synth apps are controlled and synchronized from a DJ station has been the theme of this week&apos;s experiments. The glory of MIDI is that all sorts of different effects can be manipulated, and getting these to be more fluid in a live situation is something I am making progress towards. So please enjoy the results.</p><a rel="payment" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=WX3GRUK5BHJLS">Support the show</a>
