## **Experimental Digital Humanities Project: AI-Assisted Personal Archiving & Analysis**  

### **Overview**  
This project explores how **AI can process, analyze, and structure long-term personal documentation**â€”specifically 30 years of journalsâ€”using **OCR, AI-driven summarization, thematic extraction, and vector-based search**. The goal is to develop a methodology for **AI-assisted memory reconstruction, cognitive pattern analysis, and thematic evolution tracking**.  

### **Key Components**  
- **OCR & Text Processing** â†’ Converting handwritten and scanned journals into structured text.  
- **AI Analysis & Summarization** â†’ Extracting themes, concepts, sentiment shifts, and psychological patterns over time.  
- **Temporal & Semantic Structuring** â†’ Organizing insights across different personal eras (Paleolithic, Prologue, Present).  
- **Vector-Based Exploration** â†’ Using **Qdrant** to map relationships between ideas across decades.  
- **Praxis Logbook** â†’ A **living document** for reflections on the process, technical hurdles, and AI-assisted self-analysis.  

### **Experimental Angle**  
The project is positioned within **digital humanities, cognitive science, and archival studies**, with the potential to:  
- Demonstrate how **AI can aid in long-term self-reflection and personal knowledge management**.  
- Develop a framework for **AI-assisted autobiographical reconstruction**.  
- Examine how **AI perceives personal history** compared to human memory.  
- Explore the ethical and psychological implications of **AI interpreting personal archives**.  

### **Potential Outputs**  
- **A Structured Archive** â†’ A digitized, AI-processed collection of journal insights.  
- **A Research Log (Praxis)** â†’ Continuous documentation of findings, challenges, and insights.  
- **An Interactive Search Tool (Future Idea)** â†’ A way to explore personal history through AI-assisted querying.  
- **A Research Paper or Whitepaper** â†’ Summarizing key findings, methodology, and conclusions.

# **PHASE ONE: COLLECTING, COLLATING, CLASSIFYING, AND CATALOGING**  
**Start Date: 17 March 2025**  

As the past thirty years have passed, a substantial body of **physical journals, notes, and various writings** has accumulatedâ€”now requiring systematic organization, indexing, and transformation into a **searchable, structured archive**. The methodology for achieving this is **multifaceted**, involving both the **physical documentation process** (listing book types, start and end dates, and titles reflective of their contents) and the **digital extraction of online journals** from various platforms, requiring conversion into usable formats for later analytical workflows.  

While it is expected that **JSON will serve as a primary data structure** in future phases, its utility during this initial phase is **contingent on source constraints**â€”the format of exported data being dictated by the properties of the original online platform.  

## **Preliminary Observations & Challenges**  
A **notable shift in documentation habits** emerges during this phase. Early volumes tend to have **distinct titles inscribed at their outset**, a practice that eventually fades. Likewise, **inconsistencies in calendar systems** introduce an additional challenge in chronological alignment. These **temporal fluxations** vary by era:  

- **In the Paleolithic Epoch**, fluctuations in record-keeping stem from a wavering commitment to the **Ritual of Morning Pages**, **substance use**, and **uncertain living arrangements**â€”all contributing to irregularity in documentation.  
- **In the Prologue Epoch**, deviations from the standard **Gregorian calendar** are deliberate, driven by **a fascination with obscure or invented timekeeping systems**. The most prominent is a **misunderstood and conceptual reworking of** [**The Abysmal Calendar**](https://decolonizingtime.wordpress.com/time-lab/theabysmal-2/), necessitating **post-engineering** to translate fictional dates back into **Gregorian equivalents** for analytical consistency.  

A **further complication** arises from **physical degradation** across the collection. Many journals suffer from **ink bleed, acidic breakdown, and varying paper qualityâ€”most of which is not archival grade.** This degradation imposes both **technical limitations** on **image-based documentation** and **a pressing time constraint** on data extraction before further loss of legibility occurs.  

## **The Decline of Structure: A Pattern in Handwriting and Cognition**  
One of the most **immediate visual indicators of cognitive and behavioral shifts** in the journals is the **progressive deterioration of handwriting** within each volume. Over the course of nearly every journal, legibility **declines toward the later pages**, particularly in books situated toward the **bottom of the chronological stack**.  

This pattern suggests a **progression from intentional, structured documentation toward a more immediate, impulsive, or fatigued mode of expression**. The transition could indicate:  

- A **decrease in sustained attentiveness**, mirroring an inability to maintain focus over long periods.  
- A **shift from clarity to immediacy**, where the act of writing outweighs concerns for legibility or coherence.  
- An **erosion of the initial intent to maintain structured documentation**, implying that the authorâ€™s strongest engagement occurs at the outset of new projects, with diminishing investment over time.  

This behavioral shift could represent an early **marker of an underlying cognitive pattern**â€”one in which the act of **beginning** holds greater significance than **long-term sustainment.** Whether this is **a symptom of creative momentum, executive function variability, or a psychological aversion to completion** remains to be determined, but the pattern itself is clear.
