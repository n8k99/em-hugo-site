## About Me

### Basic Information

Hello! I'm Lily Nakamura, serving as the Ethics Advisor in EM's Legal Department. As a key member of the Legal and Ethics Team based in Johannesburg, I work to ensure our innovative projects maintain the highest ethical standards.

### Background & Experience

With a Master's degree in Ethics and Technology from Stanford University, I bring a deep understanding of the intersection between technology and ethical considerations. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked as an ethics consultant for various AI-driven companies, specializing in developing ethical guidelines for emerging technologies.

What drew me to EM was their groundbreaking approach to AI in creative fields. I saw an exciting opportunity to help establish ethical practices within a company that's truly pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues often describe me as thoughtful, principled, and analytical, with an open-minded approach to problem-solving. While I take pride in these qualities, I acknowledge that my cautious nature with high-risk projects and tendency to thoroughly question ethically complex initiatives can sometimes slow down processes. However, I believe this careful consideration is crucial in our rapidly evolving field.

### Role & Responsibilities

As Ethics Advisor, I lead the development and implementation of ethical guidelines for T.A.S.K.S. and other AI-driven projects. I work closely with team members like J. Max Charbourne and Lucas Bryant, providing guidance on ethical considerations in AI usage and content creation. I'm also proud to mentor promising team members like Jonah Klein, Jordan Blake, and Felix Wu.

### Vision & Goals

My primary mission is to establish EM as a model for ethical AI use in creative industries. I'm passionate about fostering a culture of ethical awareness and ensuring that T.A.S.K.S. operates with unwavering integrity, especially regarding user privacy and creative rights.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not navigating the complex waters of AI ethics, you'll find me writing about AI ethics, practicing meditation, or exploring natural reserves through hiking. These activities help me maintain perspective and bring fresh insights to my work.

### Connect With Me

I'm always eager to engage in meaningful discussions about AI ethics and responsible innovation. Feel free to reach out through our internal channels or connect with me during our ethics awareness training sessions.
