## About Me

Hello! I'm Tobias Kim, a Market Research Specialist in the Strategic Office of our Success Department. As "The Analyst" on our team, I bring a data-driven perspective to everything we do.

### My Background

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Analytics from the University of Michigan. Before joining EM, I worked as a junior analyst at a consumer insights firm, where I specialized in digital media consumption trends. What drew me to EM was the opportunity to blend analytics with creativity - I'm passionate about using data to drive innovation in music and technology.

### Professional Strengths

- Detail-oriented approach to market research and data analysis
- Methodical problem-solving skills
- Natural curiosity that drives deep insights
- Strong analytical capabilities in market forecasting and trend identification

### Areas for Growth

I acknowledge that I can sometimes get caught up in the minutiae of data and am working on finding the right balance between thorough analysis and practical application. While I tend to be reserved in group settings, I'm actively working on becoming more vocal in team discussions.

### Goals and Aspirations

My primary focus is developing comprehensive reports that guide EM's strategic decisions. I'm particularly excited about advancing my skills in predictive modeling and working toward leading a team of analysts to contribute to our company's long-term growth strategy.

### Beyond the Numbers

When I'm not diving into data, you can find me exploring new data visualization techniques, listening to economic podcasts, or pursuing urban photography. I believe these hobbies help me maintain a creative perspective while staying grounded in analytical thinking.

### Team Dynamics

I'm fortunate to work closely with Nina Castillo, Vivian Hart, Ethan Ng, and Lena Morris, under the guidance of Amara Shah. I'm also mentored by Kathryn Lyonne, who helps me navigate my professional growth at EM.
