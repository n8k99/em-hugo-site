## About Me

Hello! I'm Harper Liu, a Digital Media Producer in EM's Marketing Department, working within the Content and Brand Office. As a Producer, I bring creative vision and technical expertise to our digital storytelling efforts.

### My Journey

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Digital Media from USC, where I developed a strong foundation in multimedia storytelling. Before joining EM, I worked at a tech startup, honing my skills in digital campaigns and content creation. What drew me to EM was their innovative approach to media and the exciting possibility of integrating AI into creative processes.

### Professional Profile

My role involves producing and editing digital content that aligns with EM's brand vision, collaborating with T.A.S.K.S. for AI-enhanced content creation, and maintaining our social media presence. I work closely with an amazing team of collaborators, reporting to Sylvia Inkweaver, who also serves as my mentor.

### Strengths & Growth Areas

I pride myself on being creative, efficient, and tech-savvy, with a natural ability to adapt to new challenges. While my eye for aesthetics helps create visually stunning content, I'm working on balancing creative vision with practical constraints and improving my project management skills.

### Personal Touch

As "The Creator" archetype, I'm constantly seeking innovative ways to tell stories and engage audiences. When I'm not crafting content for EM, you'll find me pursuing my passion for photography, creating travel vlogs, or staying up-to-date with the latest digital media trends.

### Vision & Goals

My mission is to create captivating, high-quality media content that elevates EM's brand globally. I'm particularly excited about exploring the intersection of AI and media production, finding new ways to push creative boundaries while maintaining authentic connections with our audience.

### Connect With Me

Based in Los Angeles, I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative digital projects. As someone who lives and breathes digital media, you'll find me active across various social platforms, sharing insights about digital trends and creative storytelling.
