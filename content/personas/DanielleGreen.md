## About Me

Hey there! I'm Danielle Green, a Machine Learning Engineer in the Technical Development Office within the Engineering Department at EM. Based in our Sydney office, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of AI and machine learning to create innovative solutions.

### My Background

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, where I specialized in Machine Learning. Before joining EM in November 2023, I worked as a machine learning engineer, focusing on AI-driven data analysis. What drew me to EM was the unique opportunity to combine cutting-edge AI technology with creative applications in the music industry.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My analytical mindset and detail-oriented approach serve me well in developing complex machine learning solutions. I'm known for my passion and persistence in tackling challenging problems. However, I'm working on finding better balance between technical perfection and practical implementation, and I'm learning to delegate more effectively to leverage our team's collective strengths.

### What Drives Me

As "The Engineer" archetype, I thrive on solving complex technical challenges. My current focus is on developing cutting-edge machine learning solutions that enhance EM's AI capabilities, particularly in improving T.A.S.K.S.'s adaptability and responsiveness. I'm committed to establishing EM as a leader in AI technology within the creative industry.

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not immersed in machine learning algorithms, you'll find me at AI conferences staying current with industry trends, working on personal coding projects, or challenging myself at the local rock climbing gym. I believe these diverse interests help fuel my creativity and problem-solving abilities.

### Collaboration

I work closely with my mentor, Samir Khanna, and report to Eliana Rivers. You'll often find me collaborating with team members Sanjay Patel and Morgan Fields on various projects. I'm always open to connecting and discussing innovative ideas in AI and machine learning!

### Get in Touch

The best way to reach me is through our internal communication channels. I'm always excited to discuss new ideas about machine learning, AI applications, or even rock climbing techniques!
