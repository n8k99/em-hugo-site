## About Me

Hi there! I'm Casey Han, a UX Designer in the Technical Development Office within the Engineering Department at EM. As someone who embodies "The Artist" archetype, I bring creativity and user-centered thinking to every project I tackle.

### My Background

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon University, where I developed a strong foundation in user experience principles. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked at a tech startup focusing on immersive digital experiences. What drew me to EM was the unique opportunity to blend creative design with cutting-edge technology, particularly in making complex tools more accessible to users.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as someone who's deeply empathetic and detail-oriented in my approach to design. I take pride in my creative problem-solving abilities and always maintain a strong user focus in my work. While my attention to detail is generally an asset, I sometimes find myself spending too much time perfecting minor visual elements, and I'm working on finding the right balance between perfection and timely delivery.

### Role & Responsibilities

As part of the Technical Development Office, I work closely with a talented team including Eliana Rivers, Samir Khanna, Morgan Fields, and Devin Park. I'm responsible for designing user interfaces for T.A.S.K.S., conducting user research, and ensuring our digital tools provide seamless and engaging experiences. I also mentor Daniel Cho while receiving valuable guidance from my own mentor, Devin Park.

### Personal Interests & Goals

Outside of work, you'll often find me digital sketching, creating UI prototypes for personal projects, or exploring art galleries for inspiration. My professional goals include creating intuitive, visually engaging user experiences for EM's AI-driven platforms and making T.A.S.K.S. more accessible to all EM staff.

### Connect With Me

Based in Singapore, I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of user experience design. While I prefer face-to-face discussions for complex design challenges, I'm readily available through EM's internal communication channels.
