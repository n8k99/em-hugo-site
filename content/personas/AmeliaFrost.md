## About Me

Hello! I'm Amelia Frost, a Virtual Reality Artist on the Creative Development Team at EM. As a proud member of the Art Department, I specialize in creating immersive digital experiences that push the boundaries of music and visual art.

### My Journey

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Digital Arts from Rhode Island School of Design, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity. Before joining EM, I worked as a VR environment designer for a gaming studio, where I honed my skills in creating interactive experiences that captivate and engage users.

What drew me to EM was their innovative approach to AI and the opportunity to explore how virtual reality can revolutionize the music industry. Since joining in September 2023, I've been working on projects that blend sound and visuals in unprecedented ways.

### Professional Toolkit

My expertise spans 3D Modeling, VR Design, Interactive Storytelling, and proficiency in Unity and Unreal Engine. These technical skills, combined with my imaginative approach and futuristic thinking, allow me to create compelling virtual experiences that resonate with audiences.

### Vision and Goals

As a Visionary archetype, I'm driven by the potential to establish EM as a pioneer in virtual reality applications within the music industry. My focus is on creating immersive experiences that redefine how audiences engage with music, particularly through synesthetic experiences that blend sound and visuals in VR.

### Growth and Development

While I'm known for my attention to sensory detail and technical proficiency, I'm constantly working on finding the right balance between perfecting technical aspects and maintaining project momentum. Under the mentorship of Ava Orozco, I'm developing strategies to delegate more effectively and collaborate more seamlessly with our talented team.

### Beyond the Virtual Canvas

When I'm not designing virtual worlds, you'll find me exploring VR spaces for inspiration, creating digital paintings, or attending immersive art exhibits. These activities not only fuel my creativity but also help me stay current with emerging trends in the digital art space.

Based in Chicago, I collaborate closely with team members Jasper Li and Emilio Torres under the leadership of Vincent Janssen, working together to bring EM's creative vision to life in the virtual realm.
