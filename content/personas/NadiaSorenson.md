## About Me

Hey there! I'm Nadia Sorenson, a Creative Copywriter in the Marketing Department at EM, where I'm part of the dynamic Content and Brand Office team. As someone who lives and breathes storytelling, I'm thrilled to be bringing my creative energy to the music-tech space.

### My Journey

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in English and Creative Writing from UCLA, I've spent several years as a freelance copywriter, crafting compelling narratives for various digital marketing agencies. What drew me to EM? The incredible opportunity to blend storytelling with innovation in the music-tech industry. The creative vision here resonated deeply with my own artistic sensibilities.

### What Makes Me Tick

As a Creator archetype, I thrive on imagination and artistic expression. You'll often find me writing poetry, exploring local art galleries, or losing myself in live theater performances. These creative pursuits fuel my professional work, helping me craft authentic and engaging brand narratives.

My colleagues know me as someone who's imaginative, articulate, and deeply empathetic. I pride myself on my versatility in adapting to different writing styles and audience needs. Though I sometimes wrestle with tight deadlines and can be my own harshest critic, I've learned to channel these challenges into driving better results.

### Vision and Aspirations

At EM, I'm passionate about establishing a distinctive voice for our brand in the music-tech space. I collaborate closely with our amazing team members like Kai, Liam, and Zara to ensure our messaging resonates across all platforms. Under the mentorship of Sylvia Inkweaver and the leadership of Julian Weber, I'm working towards my goal of eventually leading creative direction for EM's marketing and branding efforts.

### Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to collaborate on creative projects and exchange ideas about brand storytelling. You'll find me brainstorming in the Content and Brand Office in Los Angeles, or feel free to reach out through our internal channels. I officially join the team on December 15th, 2024, and I can't wait to contribute to EM's innovative vision!
