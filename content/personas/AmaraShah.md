## About Me

Hello! I'm Amara Shah, a Performance Analyst in the Success Department, working within the Strategic Office team. As an Analyst-level professional based in Chicago, I bring a data-driven perspective to everything I do.

### Background & Experience

I hold a Master's degree in Data Analytics from the University of Chicago. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked as a performance metrics analyst at a digital media agency, where I specialized in evaluating and enhancing digital campaign effectiveness. What drew me to EM was the exciting opportunity to explore how AI-driven media can reshape content strategy, combined with the company's ambitious vision for the future.

### Professional Strengths

As "The Analyst," I pride myself on being highly analytical, insightful, and detail-oriented. My strategic thinking capabilities allow me to:

- Analyze complex performance data to guide strategic decision-making
- Develop data-driven metrics in collaboration with T.A.S.K.S.
- Present comprehensive performance reports that align department goals with EM's strategy
- Identify growth opportunities through detailed analysis

### Areas for Growth

I acknowledge that I can sometimes become overly focused on data, and I'm working on becoming more adaptable to creative changes. These challenges push me to maintain a better balance between analytical precision and creative flexibility.

### Personal Interests & Goals

Outside of work, I'm passionate about data visualization projects and love attending tech expos to stay current with industry trends. You might also find me cheering for the Chicago Bulls or lost in a good sci-fi novel. My professional goals include building a robust performance analytics framework and ensuring our content strategy drives measurable audience engagement and growth.

### Team Connections

I'm fortunate to work closely with talented colleagues like Ethan Ng, Lena Morris, and Renee Chang. I report to and am mentored by Kathryn Lyonne, while also mentoring Renee Chang. Together with my team, I'm committed to leveraging data analytics to drive EM's success and innovation in the digital media landscape.
