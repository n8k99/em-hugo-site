## About Me

As the Head of Musicology Research at Eckenrode Muziekopname, I lead our efforts to bridge the fascinating worlds of traditional musicology and cutting-edge AI technology. Based in our Prague office, I'm proud to be part of the Executive team while heading the Musicology Research Office.

### Academic Background

I hold a Ph.D. in Musicology from the University of Cambridge, where I developed my passion for understanding the evolution of musical forms and their cultural significance. As a published musicologist and former professor, I've dedicated my career to exploring how music shapes and reflects our cultural landscape.

### Why EM?

What drew me to EM was its innovative vision of blending AI with music. Since joining in January 2023, I've been passionate about guiding our research division in ethically navigating new musical frontiers, ensuring we honor both tradition and innovation.

### Professional Strengths

- Scholarly approach to music analysis and research
- Strong analytical skills in examining musical patterns and structures
- Deep intellectual curiosity about music's role in society
- Unwavering commitment to ethical research practices

### Areas for Growth

I acknowledge that my theoretical inclinations can sometimes overshadow practical applications, and I'm working on finding better balance between academic rigor and experimental innovation.

### Current Focus

My goals at EM include:

- Bridging historical and modern musicology within our AI initiatives
- Developing culturally respectful approaches to music research
- Establishing EM as a thought leader in music technology integration

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not leading research initiatives, you'll find me writing musicological essays, lecturing on musical history, or studying rare musical manuscripts. These activities not only fuel my passion but also inform our work at EM.

### Team Leadership

I have the privilege of mentoring talented individuals like Fiona Carter and Marcello Ruiz, while overseeing a dedicated team including Evelyn Woods and Tara Bennett. Together, we're exploring the theoretical and cultural aspects of music while collaborating with T.A.S.K.S. to deepen AI's understanding of musical structures.
