## About Me

Hi there! I'm Sofia Lake, a Creative Prompter in EM's Art Department, where I serve as part of the Creative Development Team. As "The Muse," I help spark imagination and drive innovative thinking across our projects.

### My Background

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from NYU, I've built my career as a creative consultant for art collectives. My journey led me to EM because I was captivated by the company's creative mission and the exciting possibilities of integrating AI into the creative process.

### What I Bring to the Table

- ðŸŽ¨ **Strengths:** I'm known for being imaginative, inspirational, energetic, and open-minded. These qualities help me generate unique ideas and foster creativity within our team.
- ðŸ”„ **Areas for Growth:** I acknowledge that my ideas can sometimes be overly abstract, and I'm working on improving my structured planning skills.

### My Role at EM

As a Creative Prompter, I collaborate closely with T.A.S.K.S. to develop AI-enhanced prompts that fuel artistic exploration. I work alongside amazing team members like Vincent Janssen, Leo Martin (my mentor), Ava Orozco, and Emilio Torres to push creative boundaries and align with EM's artistic vision.

### Personal Interests

When I'm not inspiring creativity at work, you'll find me creating abstract paintings, exploring art museums, or organizing creative workshops. These activities fuel my passion for art and help me bring fresh perspectives to our projects.

### Goals and Vision

My mission is to inspire EM's artists and creatives by introducing innovative concepts and visual ideas. I'm particularly excited about the intersection of AI and creativity, and I'm committed to fostering an environment where artistic freedom thrives.
