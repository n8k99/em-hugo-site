## About Me

Hello! I'm Elise Park, a Human-Computer Interaction Specialist in the Technical Development Office within the Engineering Department. As a Junior Specialist, I'm passionate about creating seamless interactions between humans and technology.

### My Background

I hold a Master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon University. Before joining EM in November 2024, I worked as a UX researcher, focusing on user-centered design for AI-driven platforms. What drew me to EM was the exciting opportunity to explore the intersection of AI and user experience, particularly in innovative projects.

### Professional Profile

As "The Bridge-Builder," I specialize in connecting technical solutions with human needs. My core strengths include:

- Empathetic approach to user experience design
- Natural curiosity that drives innovation
- Detail-oriented methodology
- Proactive problem-solving

I'm constantly working on improving my decision-making confidence and finding the right balance in detail management to ensure efficient project progression.

### Current Role & Goals

At EM, I collaborate with the UX team on T.A.S.K.S., conducting usability testing and gathering user feedback to enhance our platforms. My goals include:

- Bridging the gap between technology and human interaction in EM's platforms
- Developing cutting-edge HCI methods for AI-driven applications
- Working toward leading a team focused on UX and HCI for next-generation tech projects

### Beyond the Desk

When I'm not designing interfaces, you can find me creating digital illustrations, diving into cognitive psychology books, or exploring modern art museums. These interests help inform my approach to user-centered design and keep me inspired.

### Team Connection

I'm fortunate to work with an amazing team, including my mentor Eliana Rivers and my manager Casey Han. I collaborate closely with Daniel Cho, Isaac Miller, and Morgan Fields, learning something new from each of them every day.

Based in our London office, I'm always eager to connect with colleagues and discuss innovative approaches to human-computer interaction. Feel free to reach out for collaboration opportunities or just a chat about UX design!
