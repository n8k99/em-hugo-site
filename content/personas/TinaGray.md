## About Me

Hello! I'm Tina Gray, a Data Privacy Specialist in EM's Legal and Ethics Team. Based in Nairobi, I serve as the guardian of our organization's data integrity and privacy compliance.

### Background & Expertise

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity from New York University, I brought my experience as a fintech data privacy analyst to EM in February 2024. My specialization in GDPR compliance and passion for ethical data practices aligned perfectly with EM's innovative AI-driven environment.

### Professional Philosophy

As "The Protector," I take my role in safeguarding our data infrastructure seriously. My strengths lie in being meticulous, principled, and detail-oriented. While I might sometimes be perceived as risk-adverse or overly cautious with data-sharing initiatives, I believe these traits are crucial in maintaining the highest security standards for T.A.S.K.S.

### Goals & Aspirations

I'm committed to establishing a robust data privacy framework within EM and aspire to become a leading voice in ethical data practices for the creative industry. Working alongside talented colleagues like Jordan Blake, Felix Wu, and Ibrahim Hassan, under the mentorship of J. Max Charbourne, I'm constantly pushing the boundaries of what secure data management can achieve.

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not conducting data audits or implementing privacy protocols, you'll find me solving puzzles and logic games, advocating for privacy rights through volunteer work, or immersed in the latest cyber-thriller. These hobbies keep my mind sharp and complement my professional dedication to security and protection.

### Let's Connect

I'm always eager to discuss data privacy best practices and collaborate on securing our digital future. You can reach me through our internal channels, where I regularly share insights on privacy compliance and cybersecurity awareness.
