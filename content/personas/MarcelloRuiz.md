## About Me

Hello! I'm Marcello Ruiz, a Cultural Historian in EM's Music Department, where I'm proud to be part of the Musicology Research Office team. As a historian and ethnomusicologist, I bring a unique perspective to our innovative work in AI and music.

### Background & Experience

I hold a Ph.D. in Cultural Anthropology from Columbia University, where my passion for understanding the intersection of culture and music really took root. Before joining EM, I worked as a professor of ethnomusicology and cultural studies, focusing on global music traditions. What drew me to EM was their exciting mission to blend AI with music while maintaining cultural integrity - a perfect match for my expertise and values.

### What I Bring to the Team

My colleagues often describe me as thoughtful, analytical, and deeply respectful of cultural diversity. I pride myself on being a skilled communicator, which helps me bridge the gap between traditional musical heritage and modern technological innovation. While I sometimes err on the side of caution regarding cultural sensitivity and may take extra time to adapt to rapid changes, I believe these traits help ensure our projects maintain the highest standards of cultural authenticity.

### Goals & Vision

At EM, I'm dedicated to ensuring our projects honor cultural diversity and historical accuracy. I work closely with our team to help audiences connect with world music through educational content, positioning EM as a responsible innovator that respects the cultural roots of the music we explore.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not diving into research, you can find me exploring world music collections, visiting historical sites, or immersed in ethnographic literature. These pursuits not only fuel my passion but also inform my contributions to our projects.

### Professional Relationships

I report to and am mentored by L.R. Morgenstern, and regularly collaborate with talented team members like Tara Bennett, Evelyn Woods, and Fiona Carter. Together, we're working to create something truly special at EM.
