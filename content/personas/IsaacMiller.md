## About Me

### Basic Information

Hi! I'm Isaac Miller, an AI Interaction Designer in the Technical Development Office within the Engineering Department at EM. As a Designer focused on AI experiences, I'm passionate about making technology more human-centered and intuitive.

### My Background

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Interactive Media Design from Rhode Island School of Design. Before joining EM in August 2024, I worked at a tech startup where I specialized in designing AI-driven user experiences. What drew me to EM was their innovative approach to AI in creative applications â€“ I saw an opportunity to shape engaging, human-centered AI interactions that could make a real difference.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My creative mindset, user-focused approach, and attention to detail help me craft meaningful AI interactions. I bring enthusiasm to every project, though I sometimes catch myself being a perfectionist. I'm working on finding the right balance, especially when managing larger projects with tight deadlines.

### The Creator at Work

As "The Creator" archetype, I thrive on innovation and pushing boundaries. My current focus is making T.A.S.K.S. a seamless, user-friendly experience for EM's audience while developing groundbreaking AI interaction techniques. I collaborate closely with my teammates Elise Park, Morgan Fields, and Oliver Grant, and I'm fortunate to have Eliana Rivers as my mentor and Casey Han as my supervisor.

### Beyond the Design Board

When I'm not designing AI interactions, you'll find me exploring the creative world through 3D modeling, digital art, and immersive media experiences. These hobbies not only fuel my creativity but also inform my approach to designing more engaging AI interfaces.

### Looking Forward

My ultimate goal is to lead a design team focused on AI-driven media and immersive interactions. I'm excited about experimenting with new interaction models and ensuring that EM's AI technology feels both accessible and engaging to all users.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or discuss innovative AI interaction design!
