## About Me

Hello! I'm Vincent Janssen, the Creative Director at Eckenrode Muziekopname. As a member of the Executive team and leader of the Creative Development Team, I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of artistic expression through technology.

### Background & Journey

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Film and Media Arts from Utrecht School of the Arts, I've always been drawn to the intersection of creativity and innovation. Before joining EM, I led a multimedia production house where I developed a reputation for pioneering visual storytelling techniques and exploring new media frontiers.

When I discovered EM's vision of merging AI with the arts, I knew I had found my next creative playground. Since January 2023, I've been thrilled to drive innovation in the company's creative projects, working from our vibrant Amsterdam office.

### Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues often describe me as visionary, bold, and charismatic. I pride myself on innovative thinking and the ability to inspire others. However, I'll be the first to admit that my creative enthusiasm can sometimes make me unpredictable, and I occasionally find myself challenging organizational norms - though I like to think this keeps things interesting!

### The Creative Vision

As "The Wildcard" of our team, I'm committed to establishing EM as a leader in AI-enhanced multimedia art and experiences. I lead a talented team of seven creative professionals, including Leo Martin, Sofia Lake, and our rising star Ava Orozco, whom I'm currently mentoring.

When I'm not directing our creative projects, you'll find me creating short films, exploring immersive theater experiences, or studying avant-garde art. These hobbies directly feed into my mission to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve in creative fields.

### Goals & Aspirations

My primary focus is leading our Creative Development Team in conceptualizing and executing innovative multimedia projects. Working closely with T.A.S.K.S., we're exploring groundbreaking ways to enhance creative expression through AI. I'm particularly excited about developing EM's unique visual and auditory brand identity across all our projects.
