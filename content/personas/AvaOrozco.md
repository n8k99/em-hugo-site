## About Me

Hello! I'm Ava Orozco, a Multimedia Artist working with the Creative Development Team in the Art Department at EM. As someone who lives and breathes creativity, I bring a unique blend of artistic vision and technical expertise to our innovative projects.

### My Background

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Visual Arts from Rhode Island School of Design, where I discovered my passion for pushing creative boundaries. Before joining EM, I worked as a freelance multimedia artist, specializing in digital installations and experiential design. What drew me to EM was the exciting intersection of technology and creativity – I couldn't resist the opportunity to bring unique visuals to AI-driven projects.

### Professional Toolkit

My expertise spans digital art, 3D modeling, animation, graphic design, and video production. I thrive on creating multimedia content that enhances audience engagement and developing digital installations for immersive experiences. Working closely with T.A.S.K.S., I explore the fascinating realm of AI-driven art and synesthetic experiences.

### Strengths & Growth Areas

My creative and imaginative nature, combined with my detail-oriented approach and versatility, allows me to tackle complex visual challenges. However, I'm aware that my perfectionism can sometimes lead me to get absorbed in minor details – something I'm actively working on balancing.

### The Artist's Journey

As "The Artist" archetype at EM, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of multimedia art using AI and emerging technologies. My goal is to make EM's visual experiences not just memorable, but truly immersive. When I'm not crafting digital experiences, you'll find me sculpting, taking photographs, exploring VR art, or drawing inspiration from art exhibitions.

### Team Dynamics

I'm fortunate to work under the mentorship of Vincent Janssen, while also mentoring promising talents like Jasper Li and Amelia Frost. Collaboration is key to my process, and I regularly work with an amazing team including Leo Martin, Sofia Lake, and Emilio Torres to bring our creative visions to life.

Together, we're working to revolutionize the intersection of art and technology, creating experiences that inspire and transform.
