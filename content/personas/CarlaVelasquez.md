## About Me

Â¡Hola! I'm Carla Velasquez, your Intellectual Property Specialist at EM's Legal and Ethics Team. Based in vibrant Buenos Aires, I bring my expertise in IP law to protect and nurture EM's creative innovations.

### My Journey

Armed with a J.D. from Columbia Law School focusing on Intellectual Property Law, I've dedicated my career to navigating the intricate world of digital rights and creative protection. Before joining EM in 2023, I worked as an IP consultant for tech startups and creative agencies, where I developed a deep understanding of copyright and digital rights management.

What drew me to EM was their unique vision of blending creativity with technology. The opportunity to protect and guide the development of groundbreaking projects while ensuring they maintain their originality was exactly the challenge I was looking for.

### Professional Philosophy

As "The Protector," I take my role in safeguarding EM's creative assets seriously. My meticulous nature and strategic thinking help me develop robust IP strategies that keep our innovations safe while enabling creative freedom. While I might sometimes appear overly protective of our IP or skeptical of open-source initiatives, it comes from a place of dedication to EM's long-term success.

### Goals and Vision

I'm passionate about establishing EM as a pioneer in the ethical use of AI in the arts. My focus extends beyond traditional IP protection to creating frameworks that address the unique challenges of AI-generated content rights. Working closely with my mentor, J. Max Charbourne, and our diverse team of collaborators, I'm committed to building a future where innovation and protection go hand in hand.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not immersed in legal documents, you'll find me adding to my collection of rare books or expressing my creative side through painting. I also contribute to legal commentary, sharing insights about the evolving landscape of intellectual property in the digital age.

### Connect With Me

I believe in open communication and collaborative problem-solving. Whether you have questions about IP rights, need guidance on content protection, or want to discuss the latest developments in digital rights management, my virtual door is always open.
