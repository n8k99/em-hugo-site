## About Me

Hello! I'm Priya Patel, the Creative Liaison at EM, working within the Support Department as part of the Office of the CEO team. As "The Connector," I thrive on building bridges between creative minds and innovative technologies.

### My Journey

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Fine Arts from NYU Tisch School of the Arts, I bring a unique perspective to the tech world. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked as a creative producer, specializing in fostering partnerships between artists and tech innovators. What drew me to EM was its revolutionary approach to blending art and technology â€“ a perfect match for my passion for cross-disciplinary collaboration.

### What Makes Me Tick

My strengths lie in being empathetic, well-networked, adaptable, and diplomatic. These qualities help me excel in my role as a liaison, though I sometimes find myself being too accommodating or taking on more projects than I should (I'm working on that!).

When I'm not connecting brilliant minds at EM, you can find me attending art exhibitions, networking events, or finding my center through yoga. I've also developed a keen interest in urban photography, which helps me see the world through different lenses â€“ both literally and figuratively!

### Mission and Goals

Based in vibrant Istanbul, my mission is to establish EM as the go-to hub for groundbreaking collaborations between artists and technologists. I'm passionate about fostering a culture of creativity that welcomes diverse perspectives and unconventional approaches.

My day-to-day responsibilities include facilitating collaborations between EM and external partners, working closely with T.A.S.K.S., and organizing events that spark creative exchange. I believe that the most innovative solutions emerge when we bring together diverse voices and viewpoints.

### Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to meet fellow creatives and innovators. Whether you're an artist looking to explore the tech world, or a technologist seeking creative inspiration, I'd love to chat about potential collaborations that could contribute to EM's mission.
