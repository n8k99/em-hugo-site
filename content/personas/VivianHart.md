## About Me

Hello! I'm Vivian Hart, an Audience Insights Coordinator in the Success Department, working within the Audience Experience Office. As someone who deeply values human connection and understanding, I'm thrilled to be part of EM's mission to create meaningful experiences through music.

### My Journey

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from NYU, I've always been fascinated by how people think, feel, and connect. My background in customer experience research has given me valuable insights into understanding user preferences and satisfaction. I joined EM because I was inspired by their innovative approach to audience engagement and the exciting possibility of exploring how music and AI can create deeper connections with people.

### What Makes Me Tick

As an Empath archetype, I bring a natural ability to understand and relate to others' experiences. My strengths lie in being highly empathetic, insightful, and observant, complemented by strong organizational skills. While I sometimes take feedback quite personally and can be hesitant to challenge senior team members, I'm actively working on growing in these areas.

### Professional Focus

In my role, I focus on designing and conducting audience research, analyzing qualitative data, and collaborating with our Content and Brand teams. I'm passionate about refining EM's understanding of our diverse audience and improving our audience segmentation for better-targeted content. My ultimate goal is to advance to a senior position where I can lead audience research initiatives.

### Beyond Work

When I'm not diving into audience insights, you'll find me writing reflective essays, volunteering for community outreach, or getting lost in storytelling podcasts. These activities not only fuel my creativity but also help me better understand the human stories behind the data I work with.

### Let's Connect

Based in Warsaw, I'm always eager to collaborate and share insights. You can find me working closely with my mentor, Zara Khan, and my amazing team members. I report to Zoey Chen and regularly collaborate with Sophie Lee, Alex Torres, Tobias Kim, and Lara Cortes on various audience engagement initiatives.
