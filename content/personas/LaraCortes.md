## About Me

Hello! I'm Lara Cortes, a Public Relations Associate in EM's Marketing and Communications team. Based in Boston, I'm thrilled to be joining the company on December 25th, 2024, ready to contribute my passion for storytelling and relationship building to our innovative mission.

### My Background

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Communications from Boston University, where I developed a strong foundation in media relations and public communications. Prior to joining EM, I served as a PR intern for a nonprofit organization, where I gained valuable experience managing social media channels and crafting press releases. What drew me to EM was their groundbreaking approach to combining technology and music, along with their commitment to creating meaningful connections with audiences.

### Professional Identity

As "The Advocate," I naturally gravitate towards championing causes and ideas I believe in. My strengths lie in being a strong communicator, showing empathy in my interactions, adapting to changing situations, and maintaining attention to detail. While I'm still growing in handling high-stakes media events and sometimes hesitate to take creative risks, I see these challenges as opportunities for growth.

### Goals and Aspirations

In my role, I'm focused on building strong relationships with media outlets and influencers while developing expertise in managing large-scale press events. I aspire to master the complexities of brand management and eventually lead PR campaigns. Working alongside my mentor, Oscar Diaz, and reporting to Renee Chang, I collaborate closely with team members Zara Khan and Vivian Hart to achieve these goals.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not crafting press releases or engaging with media contacts, you'll find me blogging about fashion trends, volunteering at the local animal shelter, or pursuing my passion for travel photography. These interests not only keep me creatively inspired but also help me bring fresh perspectives to our PR initiatives.

### My Role at EM

As part of the Marketing and Communications team, I assist in creating press releases and media briefs, build relationships with journalists, and work closely with our Social Media and Content teams to ensure our PR efforts align with EM's brand strategy. I'm particularly excited about analyzing the impact of our PR campaigns and contributing to EM's growing presence in the industry.
