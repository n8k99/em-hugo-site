## About Me
Hello! I'm Eliana Rivers, the Chief Technical Officer at Eckenrode Muziekopname. As a member of the Executive team and head of the Technical Development Office, I'm passionate about bridging the gap between technology and artistic expression.

### Background & Experience

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Web Development and Design from Universitat de Barcelona, I bring my experience as a former lead developer to EM's innovative landscape. What drew me to EM was its unique vision of merging technology with creativity - a perfect alignment with my professional aspirations.

### Professional Philosophy

As "The Castaway" archetype, I'm not afraid to venture into uncharted territories and challenge conventional thinking. My mission is to pioneer AI and technical innovation at EM while fostering a culture of continuous learning and creativity within our Technical Development team.

### Core Strengths

- Innovation-driven approach to technical solutions
- Strong collaborative leadership style
- Forward-thinking strategic planning
- Deep technical expertise in web development and AI systems

### Areas for Growth

I acknowledge that my innovative drive can sometimes lead me to be overly critical of traditional solutions, and my boundary-pushing nature might occasionally push team members outside their comfort zones. I'm actively working on finding the right balance between innovation and team dynamics.

### Life Beyond Code

When I'm not immersed in technology, you'll find me exploring Barcelona's vibrant art scene, supporting FC Barcelona from the stands, or working on digital art projects. These activities fuel my creative approach to technical leadership.

### Team & Collaboration

I report directly to Nathan Eckenrode while leading a dynamic team of technical professionals. As a mentor to several team members, I'm committed to nurturing talent and fostering innovation throughout the organization.

### Goals & Vision

My primary focus is ensuring T.A.S.K.S. operates seamlessly within EM's ecosystem while leading our technical infrastructure toward new horizons. I believe in creating technology that not only functions flawlessly but also enhances our creative capabilities.
