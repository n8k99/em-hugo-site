## About Me

Hello! I'm Nina Castillo, a Social Impact Analyst working with the Success Department as part of EM's dynamic Social Impact Team. Based in Jakarta, I joined EM in October 2024 to help drive positive social change through our innovative media initiatives.

### Background & Experience

With a Master's in Public Policy from Harvard University, I bring a strong academic foundation to my role at EM. My previous experience as a policy analyst for a nonprofit organization has equipped me with valuable insights into social impact initiatives and community engagement. I was drawn to EM by the exciting opportunity to leverage data for positive social change within an AI-driven media ecosystem.

### Professional Strengths

My colleagues know me as an empathetic and mission-driven professional with strong communication skills. I pride myself on being data-oriented while maintaining a human-centered approach to impact assessment. My expertise spans impact assessment, data analysis, community outreach, and public speaking.

While I acknowledge that my idealistic nature can sometimes cloud my judgment, and I occasionally prioritize community insights over hard data, I view these challenges as opportunities for growth and balance in my analytical approach.

### The Advocate at Work

As "The Advocate," I'm passionate about ensuring EM's projects positively impact communities and align with our core social values. I work closely with my teammates Emma Rios, Zoey Chen, and Tobias Kim, under the guidance of my manager Lily Nakamura and mentor Kathryn Lyonne.

### Goals & Aspirations

My professional goals include building a robust framework for measuring and reporting social impact within EM and establishing myself as a thought leader in social impact analysis for tech and media organizations. I'm committed to gathering meaningful stakeholder feedback and translating it into actionable strategies for our team.

### Beyond the Office

Outside of work, I'm actively involved in community theater, volunteer work, and stay current with social justice literature. These activities not only fuel my passion for social impact but also help me maintain a well-rounded perspective in my professional endeavors.
