## About Me

Hello! I'm Devin Park, a Performance Optimizer in the Technical Development Office within EM's Engineering Department. As "The Analyst," I'm passionate about making systems run at their absolute best.

### Background & Experience

Armed with a Computer Science degree from Stanford University, I bring valuable experience from my previous role as a systems analyst, where I specialized in optimizing AI-driven systems. What drew me to EM was their innovative approach to AI in music - I saw an incredible opportunity to help fine-tune T.A.S.K.S. for maximum performance and reliability.

### Professional Focus

My primary mission at EM involves ensuring T.A.S.K.S. operates at peak efficiency with minimal downtime. I work closely with our technical teams to monitor, analyze, and optimize system performance, always looking for ways to enhance reliability and response times.

### Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me for being methodical, solution-oriented, and incredibly persistent in solving technical challenges. I take pride in my data-driven approach to problem-solving. However, I'm aware that I can sometimes get too caught up in the details, particularly when it comes to minor inefficiencies or metrics - it's something I'm actively working on balancing!

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not optimizing systems, you'll find me tinkering with hardware or diving into competitive gaming. I'm constantly following the latest trends in AI and systems technology, always looking for innovations we can apply to our work at EM.

### Team Connections

I'm fortunate to work with an amazing team, reporting to Eliana Rivers and being mentored by Morgan Fields. I also have the privilege of mentoring Casey Han and Sanjay Patel, helping them develop their technical expertise.

### Get in Touch

I'm always eager to discuss system optimization, performance benchmarking, or anything related to making our technology run more efficiently. You'll usually find me in our Seoul office, deep in performance metrics or collaborating with our technical teams.
