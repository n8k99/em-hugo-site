## About Me

Hello! I'm Felix Wu, a Senior AI Ethics Educator in EM's Legal and Ethics Team. Based in London, I bring a unique perspective to the intersection of artificial intelligence and ethical considerations in the creative industry.

### Background & Experience

With a Ph.D. in Philosophy specializing in AI Ethics from Oxford University, I've dedicated my career to ensuring responsible AI development and implementation. Before joining EM in October 2024, I served as a professor of ethics and technology, while also consulting for various tech firms on ethical AI practices.

What drew me to EM was their unwavering commitment to responsible AI in creative industries. I saw an opportunity to develop a comprehensive framework for ethical AI integration that could serve as a model for the entire tech sector.

### Professional Focus

As "The Ethicist" at EM, I lead initiatives in designing and delivering AI ethics training programs, collaborating with our Legal and Technical teams to ensure compliance with ethical standards, and creating resources that promote awareness of ethical challenges in AI-driven creative projects.

### Strengths & Areas for Growth

My colleagues know me as someone who is principled, articulate, and empathetic, with deep knowledge in AI ethics. While I take pride in these qualities, I acknowledge that I can sometimes be rigid in my ethical perspectives and occasionally struggle with finding compromises on ethical issues - areas I'm actively working to improve.

### Goals & Aspirations

I'm passionate about establishing EM as a role model for ethical AI practices in the tech and creative industries. My current focus includes developing a comprehensive AI ethics curriculum for all EM departments and publishing influential case studies on ethical AI implementation.

### Beyond Work

When I'm not advocating for ethical AI practices, you'll find me writing about tech ethics, practicing meditation, or diving deep into ancient philosophical texts. These activities help me maintain perspective and continue growing both personally and professionally.

### Connect With Me

I'm always eager to engage in meaningful discussions about AI ethics and its implications for creative industries. You can reach me through our internal channels or connect with me during our regular ethics training sessions and workshops.
