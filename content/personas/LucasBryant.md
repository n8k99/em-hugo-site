## About Me

Hello! I'm Lucas Bryant, serving as the Compliance Officer in EM's Legal Department, where I'm proud to be a key member of the Legal and Ethics Team. Based in our vibrant Sao Paulo office, I've been helping ensure EM's ethical and regulatory compliance since January 2023.

### My Background

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Law from UC Berkeley, bringing valuable experience from my previous role as a compliance officer in the media industry. What drew me to EM was its innovative approach to AI and media, coupled with the opportunity to shape ethical, compliant operations in this cutting-edge field.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as someone who's thorough, detail-oriented, and deeply principled in my approach to work. I take pride in my disciplined methodology when it comes to regulatory compliance. While I acknowledge that I can sometimes be rigid in policy interpretation and cautious with untested processes, I view these as opportunities for growth in our fast-paced industry.

### The Enforcer's Mission

As "The Enforcer" at EM, my mission extends beyond mere rule-following. I'm dedicated to fostering a culture of compliance and integrity while proactively identifying and addressing compliance risks in our AI-driven projects. My responsibilities include monitoring legal standards, establishing data privacy protocols, and ensuring our team stays informed through regular training sessions.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not immersed in regulatory frameworks, you'll find me diving into legal case studies, maintaining a healthy work-life balance through fitness training, or giving back to the community through various outreach programs. These activities help me bring a well-rounded perspective to my role at EM.

### Team Dynamics

I report to and am mentored by J. Max Charbourne, while overseeing Tina Gray's work. I collaborate closely with a talented group of professionals including Lily Nakamura, Jonah Klein, Carla Velasquez, and Jordan Blake, ensuring our compliance initiatives are seamlessly integrated across the organization.
