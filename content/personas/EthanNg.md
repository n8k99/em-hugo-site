## About Me

Hello! I'm Ethan Ng, a Strategy Analyst in the Success Department, working within the Strategic Office team. As "The Analyst," I bring a data-driven perspective to our strategic initiatives while maintaining a keen eye for innovative solutions.

### Background & Education

I hold a Master's degree in Business Analytics from MIT Sloan School of Management. Before joining EM, I worked as a business intelligence analyst at a multinational consulting firm, where I specialized in strategic analysis for tech-driven projects. What drew me to EM was its unique commitment to merging technology and creativity â€“ I saw an opportunity to apply my analytical skills in supporting data-driven strategies in media.

### Professional Strengths

- Analytical mindset with a methodical approach to problem-solving
- Resourceful in finding innovative solutions to complex challenges
- Dedicated to delivering high-quality, data-backed insights
- Expert in data analysis, market research, and business strategy

### Areas for Growth

I acknowledge that I can sometimes be risk-averse and hesitant with unconventional ideas. I'm actively working on embracing more creative approaches while maintaining my analytical rigor.

### Goals & Aspirations

- Identifying growth opportunities for EM through rigorous market analysis
- Building a strong foundation of data-driven strategies that support EM's mission
- Staying ahead of industry trends to keep EM competitive and innovative

### Beyond the Numbers

When I'm not analyzing data or crafting strategies, you can find me following economic trends, managing my tech stock portfolio, or engaging in strategic board games. These hobbies help me maintain a balanced perspective and keep my analytical skills sharp.

### Collaboration & Mentorship

I report to and am mentored by Kathryn Lyonne, while also serving as a mentor to Lena Morris and Alex Torres. I regularly collaborate with team members across the Strategic Office, including Amara Shah, Renee Chang, and Tobias Kim.

### Connect With Me

Based in Hanoi, I'm always eager to connect with colleagues and discuss data-driven strategies or share insights about market trends. Feel free to reach out through our internal channels or schedule a virtual coffee chat!
