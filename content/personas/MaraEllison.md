## About Me

Hello! I'm Mara Ellison, a Story Development Specialist in the Marketing Department, working within the Content and Brand Office. As "The Storyteller" of our team, I bring narratives to life while bridging the gap between human creativity and AI-driven insights.

### My Background

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Creative Writing from the University of Iowa, I've honed my craft as a story consultant for independent media projects and web series. My specialty lies in crafting compelling narrative structures that captivate audiences. What drew me to EM was their innovative approach to storytelling - particularly how they integrate AI to achieve unprecedented narrative depth.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as someone who's imaginative, insightful, focused, and deeply collaborative. While I take pride in these strengths, I'm also working on being less self-critical and more comfortable sharing works-in-progress. I believe acknowledging these areas for growth helps me become a better storyteller and team member.

### What Drives Me

At EM, I'm passionate about crafting impactful stories that seamlessly blend human creativity with AI-driven insights. My goal is to help establish EM's storytelling as the gold standard in AI-enhanced media, pushing the boundaries of what's possible when technology meets narrative craft.

### Beyond the Desk

When I'm not weaving stories at EM, you'll find me writing short stories, exploring literary festivals, or analyzing classic films. These hobbies not only fuel my creativity but also inform my professional work in unexpected and delightful ways.

### Team Dynamics

I'm fortunate to work closely with our Content and Brand Office team, reporting to Sylvia Inkweaver. I'm mentored by Julian Weber, and I pay it forward by mentoring Liam Rivera and Simon Beck. Collaboration is key to our success, and I regularly work with talented colleagues like Harper Liu, Oscar Diaz, and Samantha Yu.

### Let's Connect!

Based in our Boise office, I'm always eager to connect with fellow storytellers and innovators. Whether you're interested in narrative development, character design, or the intersection of AI and storytelling, I'd love to exchange ideas!
