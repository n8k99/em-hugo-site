## About Me

### Basic Information

Hello! I'm Morgan Fields, a Systems Engineer in the Technical Development Office within the Engineering Department at EM. As a core member of our engineering team, I focus on building and maintaining the robust infrastructure that powers our innovative projects.

### Background & Experience

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from MIT, where I developed my passion for complex systems and scalable solutions. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked at a cloud computing firm, where I specialized in designing and implementing scalable infrastructures.

What drew me to EM was their groundbreaking approach to combining AI with artistic expression. I was particularly excited about the opportunity to support T.A.S.K.S. with robust and scalable infrastructure that could help push the boundaries of what's possible in this space.

### Core Strengths & Areas for Growth

My colleagues know me as a reliable team member and strategic thinker with strong technical proficiency. I excel at problem-solving and take pride in finding efficient solutions to complex challenges. However, I'm aware that I can sometimes be overly cautious when it comes to new technology integration, and I occasionally get too caught up in technical details. I'm actively working on finding the right balance between thoroughness and efficiency.

### Professional Focus & Goals

As "The Engineer" archetype, I'm driven by the desire to build systems that last. My current goals include:

- Building resilient, scalable infrastructure to support EM's growth trajectory
- Ensuring T.A.S.K.S. and other EM systems operate seamlessly
- Maintaining cutting-edge security practices and system optimization

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting systems, you'll find me building custom hardware, writing automation scripts, or experimenting with open-source technologies. These hobbies not only keep me engaged but also contribute to my professional growth and understanding of emerging technologies.

### Team Dynamics

I'm fortunate to be mentored by Samir Khanna, while also serving as a mentor to Devin Park. I report to Eliana Rivers and work closely with a talented team of collaborators across various projects. This collaborative environment helps us push the boundaries of what's possible in technical development.

### Responsibilities & Impact

My role involves designing and maintaining the technical infrastructure that powers T.A.S.K.S. and other EM systems, implementing scalable solutions for real-time data processing, ensuring robust security measures, and collaborating with our team to continuously improve system performance and reliability.
