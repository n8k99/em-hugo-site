## About Me

Welcome! I'm Jordan Blake, serving as the Policy Liaison within EM's Legal and Ethics Team. Based in our Brisbane office, I work at the intersection of innovation and compliance, ensuring our groundbreaking work aligns with legal and ethical standards.

### My Background

Armed with a Master's in Public Policy from Georgetown University, I bring valuable experience from my previous role as a policy advisor in government, where I specialized in tech and media regulations. What drew me to EM was the exciting challenge of harmonizing cutting-edge innovation with evolving legal frameworks and ethical considerations.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as a detail-oriented and principled professional with strong communication skills. I pride myself on being adaptable in our fast-paced environment. While I sometimes err on the side of caution and may initially resist rapid changes, I view these traits as opportunities to ensure thorough consideration of all implications in our work.

### The Advocate at Work

As "The Advocate" within our team, I'm passionate about three key goals:

- Ensuring all EM projects maintain compliance with current and future tech regulations
- Developing robust policy frameworks that support responsible innovation
- Establishing EM as an industry thought leader in ethical and legal AI practices

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not navigating the complex world of tech policy, you'll find me hiking local trails, diving into books about legal history, or actively participating in policy forums. These activities help me maintain perspective and stay current with evolving industry discussions.

### Collaboration & Communication

I work closely with Tina Gray and Lucas Bryant, under the mentorship of Lily Nakamura, and report to J. Max Charbourne. My role involves extensive cross-departmental communication, particularly in advising on regulatory policies and ensuring compliance across our innovative projects.

The best way to reach me is through our internal channels, where I'm always happy to discuss policy implications or provide guidance on compliance matters.
