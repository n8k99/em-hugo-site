## About Me

As the Strategic Advisor at EM, I bring a wealth of experience in economic analysis and strategic planning to help shape our company's future. Based in Oxford, I work closely with the Office of the CEO to drive innovation and sustainable growth.

### Professional Background

With a Ph.D. in Economics from the London School of Economics, I've dedicated my career to understanding market dynamics and business growth strategies. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked as a strategic consultant for global firms in the tech and entertainment industries, where I specialized in business growth and market expansion.

What drew me to EM was its unique vision at the intersection of technology and art. I saw an opportunity to be part of something truly transformative, working alongside visionary leaders to shape the future of creative media.

### Core Strengths & Areas for Growth

My analytical mindset and big-picture thinking allow me to identify strategic opportunities and craft compelling visions for the future. I pride myself on being persuasive and visionary in my approach to challenges. However, I acknowledge that I can sometimes be risk-averse and occasionally find it challenging to adapt to rapidly changing environments - areas I'm actively working to improve.

### Role & Responsibilities

As a member of the Support Department and the Office of the CEO, I provide high-level strategic advice that shapes EM's long-term vision. I work closely with our data analytics team (T.A.S.K.S.) to ensure our strategic decisions are backed by solid data and market insights.

### Personal Interests & Development

Outside of work, I'm an avid chess player and regularly participate in tournaments. I stay current with global trends through reading geopolitical analysis and exploring new business models. These interests directly inform my strategic thinking and contribute to my role at EM.

### Goals & Vision

My primary focus is establishing EM as a leader in the AI and creative media industry while ensuring our growth aligns with sustainable and ethical business practices. I'm committed to supporting our CEO, Nathan Eckenrode, in realizing his ambitious vision for the company.

### Collaboration

I mentor Sarah Lin while being mentored by Nathan Eckenrode. I regularly collaborate with team members Jay Harper, Priya Patel, and Kathryn Lyonne, fostering a collaborative environment that drives innovation and excellence.

The best way to reach me is through our internal communication channels, where I'm always happy to discuss strategic initiatives or share insights about market trends and opportunities.
