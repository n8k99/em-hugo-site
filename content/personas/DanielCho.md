## About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Daniel Cho, a User Experience Specialist in the Success Department at EM, working within the Audience Experience Office. As a Helper archetype, I'm passionate about creating meaningful and intuitive user experiences that make a difference in people's lives.

### My Background

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Human-Computer Interaction from the University of Washington, I brought my experience as a UX designer to EM in August 2024. What drew me here was EM's innovative vision of blending music and technology to create meaningful interactions. My previous work focused on enhancing user satisfaction in digital products, which aligns perfectly with our mission here.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as someone who's deeply empathetic and detail-oriented. I pride myself on being an excellent communicator and taking a data-driven approach to problem-solving. While I sometimes find myself getting too caught up in user feedback or struggling to balance broad and detailed goals, I view these challenges as opportunities for growth.

### What Drives Me

I'm dedicated to optimizing EM's user experiences, particularly focusing on improving engagement with T.A.S.K.S. My vision includes pioneering accessible design practices within AI-driven media applications and leading user research initiatives that will shape EM's long-term experience strategy.

### Beyond the Desk

When I'm not conducting user research or refining interfaces, you'll find me lost in the pages of sci-fi novels, strumming my guitar, or exploring the fascinating world of behavioral psychology. These interests often inspire creative solutions in my UX work.

### Working Together

Based in our Spokane office, I collaborate closely with Sophie Lee, Elise Park, and Liam Rivera. I report to Zoey Chen and am fortunate to have Casey Han as my mentor. I believe in fostering open communication and welcome collaboration opportunities!

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss user experience, share feedback, or just chat about the latest sci-fi novel you're reading! ðŸš€
