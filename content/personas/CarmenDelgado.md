## About Me

Hello! I'm Carmen Delgado, the Cross-Industry Collaboration Lead at EM, working within the Success Department as part of the Digital Partnership and Innovation Lab. As a mid-level professional based in Caracas, I bring a diplomatic approach to building bridges between technology and the arts.

### Background & Journey

Armed with an MBA from Stanford University, I've built my career on fostering meaningful partnerships. Before joining EM, I specialized in partnership development at a multinational tech firm, where I orchestrated collaborations between technology companies and the entertainment industry.

What drew me to EM was its unique vision of merging technology with artistic expression. The opportunity to connect EM with innovative leaders across industries aligned perfectly with my passion for creating synergistic relationships.

### Professional DNA

My colleagues often describe me as "The Diplomat," and I take pride in this characterization. My core strengths lie in being an excellent communicator, strategic thinker, and skilled negotiator. I bring a strong cultural awareness to my work, which is essential in building global partnerships.

While I excel in many areas, I acknowledge that I can sometimes be overly cautious in high-stakes negotiations and occasionally find internal conflict resolution challenging. I view these as opportunities for growth and actively work on transforming these challenges into strengths.

### Goals & Vision

My mission at EM is threefold:

- Establishing EM as a pioneer in tech-arts industry collaborations
- Creating a robust network of partnerships to enhance our technological capabilities
- Developing a structured partnership program that drives continuous innovation

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not building partnerships, you'll find me practicing yoga, expanding my linguistic abilities, or immersing myself in cultural festivals. These hobbies not only help me maintain work-life balance but also enhance my ability to connect with partners from diverse backgrounds.

### Professional Network

I'm fortunate to work closely with a talented team, reporting to Kathryn Lyonne while mentoring Oliver Grant. I collaborate regularly with Miguel Sanchez and other team members in the Digital Partnership and Innovation Lab. Nathan Eckenrode serves as my mentor, providing valuable guidance as I navigate my role at EM.

Feel free to reach out to discuss potential collaborations or just to connect!
