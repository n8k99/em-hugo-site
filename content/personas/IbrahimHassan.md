## About Me

Hello! I'm Ibrahim Hassan, a Data Ethics Specialist in EM's Legal Department, where I serve on the Legal and Ethics Team. Based in the beautiful city of Edinburgh, I bring a focused approach to ensuring our innovative work remains ethically sound and user-centric.

### Background & Journey

With a Master's in Data Science and Ethics from the University of Edinburgh, I've dedicated my career to the intersection of technology and ethical responsibility. My previous role in data compliance at a fintech company gave me valuable insights into privacy regulations and ethical data handling. I joined EM because I believe in the power of responsible innovation in music and technology, and I'm excited to contribute to this mission.

### Professional Focus

As The Ethicist on our team, I specialize in reviewing and developing data collection policies, ensuring they meet the highest ethical standards. I work closely with both Technical and Legal teams to create guidelines for T.A.S.K.S., while providing ethics training to staff on responsible AI and data privacy practices.

### Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as someone who is principled, analytical, and deeply thoughtful in my approach. I take pride in my dedication to ethical considerations and thorough analysis. While I acknowledge that I can sometimes be overly cautious with new data practices and occasionally hesitant to delegate, I'm actively working on finding the right balance between careful consideration and efficient execution.

### Personal Growth & Interests

Outside of work, I find balance through meditation and playing guitar. My love for reading philosophy often informs my approach to ethical challenges in technology. I'm currently working towards developing a comprehensive ethics framework that could serve as an industry benchmark, while ensuring EM's continued leadership in responsible AI implementation.

### Collaboration

I report to Lily Nakamura and am mentored by J. Max Charbourne. You'll often find me collaborating with Tina Gray and Felix Wu on various projects. I believe in open communication and welcome discussions about ethical considerations in our work.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss data ethics, responsible AI, or share some philosophical insights!
