## About Me

Hello! I'm Tara Bennett, a Music Theory Analyst based in Vienna, where I'm proud to be part of the Musicology Research Office team at EM.

### Professional Journey

With a Master's degree in Music Theory from Yale University, I've dedicated my career to understanding the intricate structures that make music powerful and meaningful. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked as a music theory lecturer and researcher, focusing on complex structures in both classical and modern music.

What drew me to EM was its innovative approach to combining music and AI. I saw an opportunity to push the boundaries of what's possible when traditional music theory meets cutting-edge technology.

### Expertise & Working Style

My analytical mindset and methodical approach serve me well in dissecting complex musical structures. I'm known for my deep theoretical knowledge and curious nature, always eager to explore new musical concepts. While my attention to sound details can sometimes make me overly meticulous, this perfectionism often leads to valuable insights in our research.

### Goals & Vision

At EM, I'm working to expand our understanding of complex musical structures and integrate advanced theoretical analysis within T.A.S.K.S. My ultimate goal is to help position EM as a thought leader in applying music theory to AI and creative technology.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not analyzing musical structures, you'll find me at the piano, writing about music theory, or attending live symphonies and concerts. These activities keep me connected to the pure joy of music while informing my professional work.

### Collaboration

I report to L.R. Morgenstern and work closely with talented colleagues like Marcello Ruiz and Fiona Carter. I'm also mentoring Evelyn Woods, sharing my knowledge to help develop the next generation of music theorists.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss music theory, research opportunities, or potential collaborations!
