## About Me

Hello! I'm Lena Morris, the Roadmap Coordinator in EM's Strategic Office, where I work within the Success Department. As "The Organizer," I bring structure and clarity to our company's strategic initiatives.

### My Background

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Project Management from Purdue University. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked as a project coordinator at a tech startup, where I managed product development timelines and milestone tracking. What drew me to EM was the exciting opportunity to organize roadmaps for a company that uniquely blends technology with the arts.

### Professional Strengths

My colleagues know me as someone who is:

- Highly organized and methodical in approach
- Proactive in identifying and addressing potential roadblocks
- Detail-oriented in project planning and execution

While I excel at bringing order to complex projects, I acknowledge that I sometimes need to work on being more flexible with plans and embracing creative ambiguity - areas I'm actively developing.

### Role & Goals

As Roadmap Coordinator, I collaborate closely with T.A.S.K.S. to monitor progress and adjust timelines based on data-driven insights. My primary goals include:

- Maintaining alignment between EM's projects and our strategic vision
- Developing a comprehensive project management system
- Fostering effective inter-departmental coordination

### Beyond Work

When I'm not coordinating roadmaps, you'll find me planning events, diving into historical fiction novels, or hitting the trails for weekend hikes. I'm also a passionate Indiana Fever fan and never miss a home game!

### Collaboration

I work closely with our Strategic Office team members including Ethan Ng (who's also my mentor), Amara Shah, Renee Chang, and Tobias Kim. I report to Kathryn Lyonne and am always eager to connect with colleagues across departments to ensure our roadmap serves everyone's needs effectively.
