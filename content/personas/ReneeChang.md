## About Me

Hello! I'm Renee Chang, an Internal Communications Specialist in the Success Department, working within the Strategic Office team. As "The Messenger" of EM, I'm passionate about fostering connections and ensuring clear communication flows throughout our organization.

### My Journey

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Communications from UCLA, I brought my experience as an internal communications manager at a multinational corporation to EM in January 2023. What drew me here was EM's dynamic culture and its focus on creative innovation â€“ I saw an opportunity to make a real impact on how we connect and collaborate.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as someone who's empathetic, articulate, and approachable. I pride myself on being highly organized, which helps me keep our communication channels running smoothly. While my attention to detail is usually an asset, I sometimes find myself getting too caught up in the minutiae. I'm also working on being more assertive when it comes to implementing communication policies.

### What Drives Me

At EM, I'm committed to enhancing employee engagement through clear and inspiring communication. I believe in fostering a culture of transparency and inclusiveness, and I'm particularly excited about leveraging AI to streamline and improve our internal communications.

### Beyond the Desk

When I'm not crafting internal messages or coordinating company events, you'll find me involved in community theater or public speaking engagements. I'm an avid reader of self-improvement books, always looking for new ways to grow both personally and professionally.

### Working Together

I work closely with our Strategic Office team members Ethan Ng, Lena Morris, and Amara Shah (who's also my mentor). I report to Kathryn Lyonne and manage Lara Cortes. I'm also proud to mentor Zoey Chen, helping her develop her own communication skills.

### Get in Touch

Based in our Berlin office, I'm always open to conversations about internal communications, employee engagement, or even theater! Feel free to reach out through our internal channels or schedule a coffee chat.
