## About Me

Hello! I'm Zoey Chen, the Community Engagement Manager in the Success Department at EM, where I lead our Audience Experience Office initiatives. Since joining in June 2023, I've been passionate about building bridges between our innovative AI technology and our vibrant community.

### My Background

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Communications from USC, I brought my experience as a community manager at a tech startup to EM. What drew me here was the company's innovative approach to AI and the opportunity to build a vibrant, connected community around the brand.

### Professional Style & Approach

As "The Advocate," I'm naturally drawn to supporting and empowering others. My strengths lie in being an enthusiastic and empathetic communicator, with a strong focus on building meaningful relationships. While I occasionally need to remind myself to set boundaries and avoid burnout due to my highly responsive nature, these challenges only make me more relatable to our community members.

### Goals & Vision

My mission at EM is threefold:

- Creating an engaged, supportive community around our projects and vision
- Establishing EM as a trusted, community-driven brand in the AI and music spaces
- Leveraging community feedback to shape our future strategies

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not fostering our community, you'll find me volunteering, engaging in public speaking opportunities, or exploring cultural festivals. These activities not only energize me but also provide valuable insights that I bring back to our community engagement strategies.

### Team Dynamics

I'm fortunate to lead a talented team of four community specialists while reporting to Sylvia Inkweaver. I'm also grateful to have Renee Chang as my mentor, while mentoring Zara Khan. This multi-layered support system helps me grow both professionally and personally.

### Let's Connect!

I believe in the power of authentic connections and am always excited to engage with our community members. Whether you're interested in our latest initiatives or just want to share your thoughts, I'm here to listen and collaborate!
