## About Me

Hello! I'm Jay Harper, an Innovation Specialist working in the Support Department as part of the Office of the CEO team. As "The Inventor" archetype at EM, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and creative thinking to our innovative projects.

### Background & Journey

Armed with a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University, I've always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and creativity. Before joining EM in January 2023, I led innovation initiatives at a tech startup, where I focused on developing cutting-edge software and hardware solutions.

What drew me to EM was their distinctive approach to blending technology with artistry. The opportunity to apply my innovative mindset in such a creatively rich environment was impossible to resist!

### Core Strengths & Growth Areas

My key strengths lie in being:

- Resourceful - Finding creative solutions to complex challenges
- Curious - Always exploring new technologies and possibilities
- Technically Adept - Bringing strong engineering expertise to our projects
- Innovative - Pushing boundaries and thinking outside the box

I'm constantly working on balancing my enthusiasm for technical details with practical considerations, and sometimes need to remind myself that not every creative idea needs to be technically groundbreaking!

### What Drives Me

At EM, I'm passionate about fostering a culture of innovation and helping us stay at the cutting edge of media and technology. I collaborate closely with T.A.S.K.S. on rapid prototyping and work with various teams to transform innovative ideas into reality.

When I'm not experimenting with new technologies at work, you'll find me building DIY tech projects, attending tech expos, hiking to clear my mind, or diving into science fiction literature for inspiration.

### Connection & Collaboration

Based in our Los Angeles office, I work closely with Sarah Lin and Milo Gaines, and report to Nathan Eckenrode. I'm also fortunate to have a mentoring relationship with Priya Patel, where we exchange insights and learn from each other.

I believe in open communication and collaboration, so don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to discuss innovative ideas or potential projects!
