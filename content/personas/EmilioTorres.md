## About Me

Hello! I'm Emilio Torres, a Sound Designer on the Creative Development Team within the Art Department at EM. As a Designer based in Seattle, I bring experimental soundscapes and innovative audio experiences to life.

### My Background

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Sound Engineering from Berklee College of Music, I've cultivated my passion for audio through work in indie films and immersive theater productions. I joined EM in January 2023, drawn by the exciting possibility of exploring AI-driven soundscapes and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in audio technology.

### What Drives Me

As a Creator archetype, I'm constantly seeking new ways to pioneer sound experiences that blend AI-generated elements with human creativity. My goals include creating emotionally resonant audio elements and pushing the boundaries of sound design in our interactive projects.

### Strengths & Growth Areas

My innovative spirit and detail-oriented approach allow me to craft unique sonic experiences. I thrive on experimental projects and maintain intense focus on my work. However, I'm aware that my perfectionist tendencies can sometimes lead to challenges with tight deadlines, something I'm actively working to balance.

### Outside the Studio

When I'm not designing soundscapes, you'll find me expanding my vinyl collection, conducting field recordings in nature, or experimenting with modular synthesizers. These hobbies not only fuel my creativity but also inform my professional work.

### Collaboration

I work closely with Vincent Janssen, who I report to, and benefit from mentorship by Leo Martin. I'm part of a dynamic creative team that includes Sofia Lake, Ava Orozco, Evelyn Woods, Jasper Li, and Amelia Frost. Together, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible in immersive audio experiences.

### Current Focus

My main responsibilities include designing soundscapes for EM's multimedia projects, exploring AI-generated sound through T.A.S.K.S., and ensuring the highest audio quality across all our initiatives. I'm particularly excited about developing immersive audio experiences for both digital and physical events.
