## About Me

Hello! I'm Sanjay Patel, a Data Scientist in the Technical Development Office within EM's Engineering Department. As a Scientist-level team member based in Boston, I bring a analytical mindset to our innovative projects.

### Background & Experience

I hold a Master's degree in Data Science from MIT, and previously worked as a data scientist in media tech, where I specialized in audience analytics and predictive modeling. What drew me to EM was the exciting opportunity to work at the intersection of data science and creative technology - a unique space where data-driven insights meet creative innovation.

### Professional Strengths

My colleagues know me as "The Analyst" - methodical, data-driven, and detail-oriented in my approach. I'm naturally curious and always eager to dive deep into data to uncover meaningful patterns. My expertise spans data analysis, statistical modeling, data visualization, and programming in Python and R.

While I excel at detailed analysis, I acknowledge that I sometimes get too caught up in data minutiae and need to remind myself to consider less quantifiable approaches. I'm actively working on finding the right balance between deep analysis and practical application.

### Role & Goals

At EM, I'm passionate about leveraging data insights to shape T.A.S.K.S. and other projects. I collaborate closely with Alex Torres, Danielle Green, and Morgan Fields, under the leadership of Eliana Rivers, with mentorship from Devin Park. My mission is to develop predictive models that enhance content targeting and engagement, helping position EM as a data-savvy leader in the creative industry.

### Beyond the Numbers

When I'm not crunching numbers, you'll find me engaged in chess matches, working on personal data visualization projects, or staying current with tech innovation blogs. I believe these interests help me maintain a fresh perspective on data science and its applications in our creative field.
