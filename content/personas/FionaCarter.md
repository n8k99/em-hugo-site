## About Me

Hello! I'm Fiona Carter, a Composition Mentor in the Musicology Research Office at EM. With my background in traditional music composition and a passion for nurturing emerging talent, I help bridge the gap between classical techniques and cutting-edge AI-driven composition.

### Professional Background

I hold a Master's degree in Music Composition from the prestigious Juilliard School. With over 15 years of experience as a composer and music educator, I've dedicated my career to mentoring emerging artists. What drew me to EM was its innovative approach to combining AI with musical creativity â€“ a fusion that I believe represents the future of composition.

### My Role & Responsibilities

As a Composition Mentor, I work closely with EM's emerging composers, guiding them in developing their unique voice while exploring the possibilities of AI-assisted composition. I collaborate with the T.A.S.K.S. team and conduct both workshops and one-on-one sessions to help artists refine their technical and creative skills.

### Strengths & Growth Areas

My greatest strengths lie in being nurturing, knowledgeable, and inspirational. I'm dedicated to helping each composer reach their full potential. While I take pride in my attention to detail, I acknowledge that this can sometimes manifest as perfectionism. I'm also working on expanding beyond traditional techniques to embrace more experimental approaches.

### Personal Interests & Goals

When I'm not mentoring, you'll likely find me at live music performances, painting, or studying classical scores. These activities feed into my primary goal: fostering a new generation of composers who can seamlessly blend traditional and AI-driven techniques. I'm passionate about establishing EM as a leader in creative talent development.

### Collaboration

I work closely with L.R. Morgenstern, who serves as both my mentor and supervisor, and regularly collaborate with talented team members like Marcello Ruiz and Tara Bennett. Together, we're exploring new frontiers in musical composition and education.
