## About Me

¡Hola! I'm Miguel Sanchez, your Innovation Partnerships Manager here at EM. Based in the vibrant city of Buenos Aires, I work within the Success Department as part of our dynamic Cross-Functional Team.

### My Journey

Armed with an MBA in Strategic Management from the Wharton School of Business, I brought my passion for innovation to EM in April 2024. Before joining this amazing team, I worked as a business development manager in the tech industry, where I specialized in building innovation-driven partnerships. What drew me to EM was their unwavering commitment to pioneering technologies in creative fields – a perfect match for my vision of transformative partnerships.

### What Makes Me Tick

As "The Visionary," I'm constantly looking ahead to spot the next big opportunity. My colleagues know me for being forward-thinking, an excellent networker, and highly strategic in my approach. While my drive and enthusiasm sometimes lead me to take on too many projects simultaneously (I'm working on that!), my strategic mindset helps me navigate complex partnership landscapes.

### Goals & Aspirations

My mission is clear: to establish EM as a leader in innovative partnerships across tech and creative industries. I'm focused on building a robust portfolio of collaborations that drive our growth and influence, while creating a framework for sustainable, high-impact partnerships.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not crafting partnership strategies, you'll find me exploring tech meetups, diving into books about emerging markets, or mentoring startups. I believe in staying connected with the pulse of innovation, and these activities help me bring fresh perspectives to our partnerships.

### Working Together

I collaborate closely with my talented team members Emma Rios and Carmen Delgado, under the guidance of Kathryn Lyonne. I'm also fortunate to have Nathan Eckenrode as my mentor, helping me navigate the exciting challenges we face in the innovation space.

Let's connect and explore how we can create groundbreaking partnerships together! You can reach me through our internal channels or schedule a virtual coffee chat to discuss innovative collaboration opportunities.
