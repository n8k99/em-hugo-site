## About Me

Hello! I'm Sophie Lee, a Cultural Impact Researcher in the Success Department at EM, where I'm part of the dynamic Audience Experience Office team. As someone who embodies "The Seeker" archetype, I'm constantly exploring the fascinating intersection of technology, music, and cultural trends.

### My Journey

Armed with a Master's degree in Anthropology from UC Berkeley, I've always been fascinated by how digital media shapes our cultural landscape. Before joining EM in July 2024, I worked as a research analyst at a think tank, where I developed my expertise in analyzing digital media's impact on cultural trends.

What drew me to EM was their innovative approach to blending technology and culture. I'm particularly excited about exploring how AI is transforming the music industry and its broader social implications.

### Professional Strengths

- Observant and analytical approach to cultural research
- Open-minded perspective when exploring new cultural phenomena
- Passionate about understanding global media trends
- Expert in cultural analysis and research methodologies

### Areas for Growth

I recognize that I sometimes get too caught up in the details when discussing bigger picture concepts, and I'm working on finding the right balance. I'm also pushing myself to be more vocal with my opinions, knowing that my unique perspective can add value to our team discussions.

### Current Focus & Goals

Based in Manila, I work closely with my manager Zoey Chen and collaborate with team members Daniel Cho and Vivian Hart. My current initiatives include:

- Analyzing EM's media projects' cultural impact across different demographics
- Conducting research on cross-cultural music and technology trends
- Working towards publishing thought leadership pieces on AI's role in cultural trends
- Developing strategies to enhance EM's cultural relevance in various markets

### Beyond Work

When I'm not diving into research, you'll find me exploring world music, traveling to experience different cultures firsthand, or working on documentary film projects. These hobbies not only fuel my passion for cultural understanding but also inform my professional insights.
