## About Me

Hello! I'm Oliver Grant, a Tech Incubator Specialist in the Success Department at EM, where I'm part of the Digital Partnership and Innovation Lab team. Based in our Oslo office, I joined EM in November 2024 to help bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and creative innovation.

### Background & Experience

With a Bachelor's in Computer Science from MIT, I've built my career at the intersection of technology and innovation. Before joining EM, I worked as a startup consultant, helping early-stage tech ventures develop scalable products. What drew me to EM was their unique commitment to integrating technology with creative arts, and I'm excited to help foster tech innovations in this structured yet creative environment.

### Core Strengths & Growth Areas

I pride myself on being forward-thinking and resourceful, with a strong network-oriented approach and a willingness to take calculated risks. While my futuristic mindset helps drive innovation, I'm working on balancing my enthusiasm for rapid advancement with the need for sustainable, well-paced project development.

### Role & Aspirations

As "The Innovator," I scout emerging technologies and assess their potential integration with EM projects. I collaborate closely with engineers and designers to prototype new tools for EM's creative workflows, while building relationships with startups and tech partners. My ultimate goal is to establish EM as a hub for cutting-edge tech and creative collaboration, eventually leading our internal incubator program.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not working on the next big tech innovation, you'll find me developing apps, mentoring young tech entrepreneurs, or exploring the possibilities of virtual reality. I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and fostering a community of innovation, both within and outside EM.

### Connect With Me

I'm always eager to discuss new technologies, innovation strategies, or potential collaborations. You can find me in the Oslo office or reach out through our internal channels. I regularly collaborate with Carmen Delgado, Devin Park, and Isaac Miller, and I'm fortunate to have Eliana Rivers as my mentor.
