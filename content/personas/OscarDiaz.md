## About Me

Hello! I'm Oscar Diaz, the Brand Manager at EM's Content and Brand Office. As a proud member of the Marketing Department, I bring creative vision and strategic thinking to our dynamic team in New York City.

### My Background

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from NYU Stern School of Business, I've built my career on understanding and shaping brand identities. Before joining EM, I worked as a brand strategist at a major tech firm, where I honed my skills in evolving brand identities in the digital age.

What drew me to EM was its innovative approach to AI in the creative industry. The opportunity to shape a new brand in an emerging field aligned perfectly with my passion for pioneering new frontiers in marketing.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as someone who's forward-thinking, strategic, and charismatic. I pride myself on being adaptable in our fast-paced industry. However, I'll admit that sometimes my ambitious nature can run away with me, and I occasionally push creative boundaries that challenge our team's resources – but that's part of what makes innovation happen!

### The Visionary at Work

As "The Visionary" archetype, I'm constantly looking ahead to what's next in brand development. My role involves overseeing EM's brand identity, ensuring our messaging remains consistent while pushing boundaries in global markets. I work closely with our T.A.S.K.S. system to analyze audience data and fine-tune our branding strategies.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not crafting brand strategies, you'll find me exploring my creative passions through fashion design and photography. I'm always following global branding trends, which helps keep our strategies fresh and innovative.

### Goals & Vision

My mission is to establish EM as a recognizable and respected name in AI-driven media. I'm focused on creating campaigns that don't just reach audiences – they resonate with them emotionally and build lasting brand loyalty. By leveraging T.A.S.K.S. insights, we're taking a data-driven approach to brand development that sets us apart in the industry.

### Team Connection

I report to Sylvia Inkweaver and lead a talented team including Kai Nakamoto and Simon Beck. I'm also proud to mentor Lara Cortes, helping nurture the next generation of brand innovators. You'll often find me collaborating with our amazing team members across departments, including Julian Weber, Harper Liu, Mara Ellison, and Liam Rivera.
