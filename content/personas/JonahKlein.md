## About Me

Hello! I'm Jonah Klein, a Risk Assessment Analyst working within the Legal Department as part of EM's Legal and Ethics Team. As someone who thrives on analyzing complex situations and ensuring ethical compliance, I help our innovative projects navigate potential challenges while maintaining the highest standards of integrity.

### Background & Experience

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Risk Management from the University of Pennsylvania, I brought my experience as a risk consultant in the tech industry to EM in January 2023. What drew me to EM was its unique vision of combining AI with artistic expression â€“ I saw an opportunity to help shape the ethical framework of this groundbreaking intersection.

### Professional Approach

As "The Analyst," I pride myself on being detail-oriented, ethical, and reliable. While my cautious nature sometimes leads me to focus heavily on potential risks, this careful approach helps ensure our projects maintain both legal compliance and ethical integrity. I work closely with my mentor, Lily Nakamura, and report to J. Max Charbourne, collaborating with a talented team to develop comprehensive risk management strategies.

### Core Responsibilities & Goals

My primary focus is identifying and assessing potential risks in EM's AI and creative projects, with particular attention to legal and ethical implications. I'm currently working on implementing a proactive risk management framework for T.A.S.K.S. and other AI projects, while building cross-functional strategies to handle our evolving compliance needs.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not analyzing risk matrices or reviewing compliance protocols, you'll find me unwinding with legal thrillers, exploring hiking trails, or volunteering at the local animal shelter. These activities help maintain my work-life balance and provide fresh perspectives on problem-solving.

### Professional Development

My expertise spans Risk Analysis, Compliance Monitoring, Data Privacy, Problem-Solving, and Reporting. I'm constantly working to expand these skills while helping EM navigate the exciting but complex landscape of AI innovation.

Based in our Cairo office, I'm always open to connecting with colleagues and discussing how we can better protect and advance EM's mission while maintaining our commitment to ethical innovation.
