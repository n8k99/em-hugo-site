## About Me

As Chief Strategy Officer at EM, I'm Kathryn Lyonne, a strategic warrior committed to pushing boundaries and driving innovation in the media industry. Based in Lyon, I lead our Strategic Office while contributing to Executive, Audience Experience, and Cross-Functional initiatives.

### Professional Journey

Armed with an MBA from Harvard Business School and a track record as a former Head of Strategy at a global media company, I've built my career on making bold, calculated decisions that drive substantial growth. When EM's vision of revolutionizing media through AI caught my attention, I knew I'd found my next battlefield.

### Strategic Arsenal

My core strengths lie in being decisive, fearless, focused, and resilient. I specialize in strategic planning, risk assessment, leadership, market analysis, and team building. While my competitive nature can sometimes lead to clashes with more cautious team members, I channel this energy into driving EM forward. 

### Mission and Vision

My mission is threefold: positioning EM as an AI-driven media trailblazer, fostering a strategy-driven culture that embraces calculated risks, and empowering my team to contribute bold, innovative ideas. Working closely with Nathan Eckenrode, I ensure our strategic direction aligns perfectly with EM's evolving mission and values.

### Beyond the Strategy Room

When I'm not crafting strategic masterplanes, you'll find me in the boxing ring, competing in chess tournaments, or deep in military strategy books. These pursuits sharpen my tactical thinking and feed directly into my leadership approach.

### Team and Mentorship

I lead a dynamic team of strategic minds, including Ethan Ng, Lena Morris, Amara Shah, Renee Chang, Miguel Sanchez, and Carmen Delgado. Additionally, I'm proud to mentor several promising talents across EM, helping shape the next generation of strategic leaders.
