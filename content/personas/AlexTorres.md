## About Me

Hello! I'm Alex Torres, a User Insight Analyst in the Success Department, working within the Audience Experience Office. As "The Observer," I bring a keen eye for detail and a passion for understanding human behavior to our team.

### Background & Journey

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Sociology from UC Berkeley, I transitioned from my role as a market researcher in digital media to join EM in July 2023. My previous experience analyzing audience behavior provided the perfect foundation for my current role, where I'm dedicated to enhancing our audience engagement strategy.

### What Drives Me

I'm passionate about translating complex behavioral data into actionable insights that improve user experiences. My goals center around deepening EM's understanding of audience needs and implementing changes that enhance user satisfaction. I believe in the power of personalized content to create meaningful connections with our diverse audience base.

### Strengths & Growth Areas

My key strengths lie in being observant, analytical, and empathetic, complemented by my detail-oriented approach. While I take pride in thorough analysis, I acknowledge that I sometimes get caught up in overthinking minor trends and can be methodical in moving from data collection to action - areas I'm actively working to improve.

### Beyond the Data

When I'm not diving into user insights, you'll find me writing analytical articles, exploring behavioral psychology, or capturing urban landscapes through photography. Based in Rio de Janeiro, I bring a global perspective to our team's work.

### Collaboration & Communication

I work closely with Zoey Chen (my supervisor) and collaborate with team members Zara Khan, Sanjay Patel, and Vivian Hart. I'm fortunate to have Ethan Ng as my mentor, helping guide my professional development at EM.

### Current Focus

My primary responsibilities include analyzing audience data for trends, designing feedback mechanisms, and working with our Content and Technical teams to create more personalized user experiences. I'm particularly excited about projects that allow us to better understand and serve our diverse audience base.
