## About Me

Hello! I'm Samir Khanna, an AI Architect in the Engineering Department, working within the Technical Development Office. As "The Builder" archetype, I thrive on creating innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and creativity.

### Background & Experience

With a Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford University, I bring deep expertise in AI and machine learning to EM. Before joining in January 2023, I worked as a Senior AI developer in biotech, where I specialized in designing machine learning models for predictive diagnostics.

What drew me to EM was the exciting opportunity to shape AI architecture that merges technology with artistic expression. I believe in the power of AI to enhance creative processes, and that's exactly what we're building here.

### Core Strengths & Areas for Growth

    - Visionary thinking with strong technical skills
    - Highly analytical and detail-oriented approach
    - Deep expertise in AI architecture and machine learning
- ðŸ”„ **Growth Areas:**
    - Working on managing my tendency to be overly ambitious with AI capabilities
    - Striving to simplify solutions when complexity isn't necessary

### Professional Focus & Goals

As an AI Architect, I'm dedicated to creating a responsive, adaptive AI framework for T.A.S.K.S. that pushes the boundaries of creative AI applications. My mission is to ensure EM remains at the forefront of AI innovation while maintaining practical, user-focused solutions.

### Team & Mentorship

I report to and am mentored by Eliana Rivers, while having the privilege of mentoring Morgan Fields and Danielle Green. I regularly collaborate with a talented team including Devin Park and Casey Han, working together to advance EM's technical capabilities.

### Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting AI solutions, you'll find me deep in AI research papers, coding for fun, or mentoring AI enthusiasts. I believe in staying current with the latest developments in AI and sharing that knowledge with others.
