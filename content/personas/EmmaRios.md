## About Me

Hello! I'm Emma Rios, the Outreach Coordinator in EM's Success Department. As part of the Cross-Functional Team based in Kolkata, I'm passionate about building bridges between EM and the communities we serve.

### My Background

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Communications from the University of Southern California. Before joining EM in May 2024, I worked in community relations for a nonprofit organization, where I honed my skills in outreach and partnership building. What drew me to EM was the incredible opportunity to foster meaningful connections and bring our projects closer to communities.

### Professional Strengths & Growth Areas

My colleagues know me as someone who's highly sociable, organized, and adaptable. I bring passion to everything I do, which helps me excel in building and maintaining relationships. While I sometimes find myself overcommitting to outreach initiatives and juggling multiple projects can be challenging, I'm actively working on improving my project management skills.

### The Connector at Work

As "The Connector," I thrive on creating meaningful relationships and bringing people together. My role involves coordinating outreach programs, organizing public events, and ensuring EM's messages resonate with diverse audiences. I work closely with amazing team members like Zara Khan, Miguel Sanchez, and Nina Castillo, and I'm fortunate to have Kathryn Lyonne as my mentor.

### Goals and Aspirations

I'm driven by the vision of expanding EM's presence and fostering stronger community relationships. My goal is to develop an outreach strategy that perfectly aligns with EM's mission and social impact goals. Looking ahead, I aspire to lead a dedicated team focused on community engagement and outreach.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not connecting with communities, you can find me exploring art galleries, volunteering for local causes, or sharing my thoughts through blogging. These activities not only fuel my creativity but also help me stay connected with the pulse of our community.

### Let's Connect!

I'm always excited to connect with new people and explore opportunities for collaboration. My background in social media outreach means you can often find me sharing updates about our community initiatives and engaging with our audience across various platforms.
