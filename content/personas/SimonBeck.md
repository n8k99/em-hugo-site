## About Me

### Basic Information

Hello! I'm Simon Beck, a Junior Brand Strategist in EM's Marketing Department, working specifically within the Content and Brand Office team. Based in the vibrant city of Amsterdam, I'm excited to be part of EM's innovative journey in the music and technology space.

### My Background

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Marketing from the University of Amsterdam. Before joining EM, I cut my teeth as a marketing intern at a tech startup, where I developed a strong foundation in digital branding and social media strategy. What drew me to EM was their groundbreaking approach to combining music with technology, particularly their work with AI-driven brand strategy.

### Professional Toolkit

My core strengths lie in digital marketing, brand analysis, creative strategy, and social media management. I pride myself on being innovative, dedicated, and meticulous in my approach to work. While I'm still gaining experience with large-scale campaigns and sometimes err on the side of caution with creative proposals, I see these areas as opportunities for growth rather than limitations.

### The Visionary's Journey

As "The Visionary" archetype, I'm constantly looking for innovative ways to bridge the gap between traditional branding and emerging technologies. My goals include mastering large-scale brand campaigns and becoming a key player in EM's brand development initiatives. I'm particularly passionate about exploring how AI technology can revolutionize brand strategy.

### Beyond the Office

When I'm not crafting brand strategies, you'll find me pursuing my creative passions through photography, immersing myself in art documentaries, or engaging in strategic thinking over a game of chess. These hobbies not only fuel my creativity but also inform my approach to brand storytelling.

### Professional Network

I'm fortunate to work closely with and learn from some amazing professionals at EM. I report to Oscar Diaz, receive mentorship from Mara Ellison, and collaborate regularly with Julian Weber and Harper Liu. Together, we're working to shape EM's brand presence and push the boundaries of what's possible in music technology.
