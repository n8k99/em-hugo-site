## About Me

### Basic Information

Hello! I'm Sarah Lin, the Personal Assistant in the Office of the CEO at EM. Based in our Atlanta office, I joined the Support Department in January 2023, where I work closely with our CEO, Nathan Eckenrode, and our dynamic leadership team.

### Background & Experience

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from UC Berkeley. Before joining EM, I worked as an executive assistant at a high-growth tech startup, where I honed my skills in complex schedule management and multi-project coordination. What drew me to EM was its creative mission and the exciting opportunity to support innovation at the highest level.

### Professional Strengths

- Highly organized and efficient in managing complex tasks
- Exceptional discretion when handling sensitive information
- Dedicated to maintaining smooth operations
- Expert in time management and scheduling
- Strong communication and problem-solving abilities

### Areas for Growth

I acknowledge that my detail-oriented nature can sometimes lead to being overly meticulous, and I'm actively working on finding the right balance. I'm also focusing on improving my delegation skills to enhance team efficiency.

### The Organizer at Work

As "The Organizer," I thrive on creating order from chaos and ensuring everything runs like clockwork. My primary goals include streamlining our CEO's daily operations, building robust communication channels between the executive office and other departments, and continuously improving our internal processes.

### Beyond the Desk

When I'm not coordinating meetings or managing schedules, you'll find me on my yoga mat, diving into the latest productivity books, or experimenting with new baking recipes. These hobbies help me maintain the balance and focus needed to excel in my role.

### Collaboration

I work closely with team members like Priya Patel, Jay Harper, and Kathryn Lyonne, and I'm fortunate to have Milo Gaines as my mentor. Together, we're committed to supporting EM's mission and driving efficiency across the organization.

Feel free to reach out if you need assistance with executive office matters - I'm here to help!
