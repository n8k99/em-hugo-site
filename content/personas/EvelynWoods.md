## About Me

Hello! I'm Evelyn Woods, a Soundscape Specialist in EM's Music Department, where I work within the Musicology Research Office. As someone who embodies "The Explorer" archetype, I'm constantly seeking new sonic adventures and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in sound design.

### Background & Journey

Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Ethnomusicology from UCLA, I've dedicated my career to exploring the intersection of sound and experience. Before joining EM in January 2023, I worked as a sound designer creating immersive auditory experiences for environmental art installations. What drew me to EM was its innovative approach to combining technology and music - a perfect playground for exploring how soundscapes can enhance immersive experiences.

### What I Bring to the Table

My strengths lie in my adventurous spirit, creative approach, and meticulous attention to detail. I'm particularly passionate about cultural soundscapes, which allows me to bring unique perspectives to our projects. While I sometimes get lost in the minutiae of sound details or lose track of time during field recordings (who wouldn't when capturing the perfect sound?), these "weaknesses" often lead to discovering unexpected sonic gems.

### Current Focus & Goals

At EM, I'm working on expanding our sound library with unique environmental and cultural soundscapes while exploring the integration of AI in sound design. My ultimate goal is to help position EM as an innovator in soundscape creation within the music and tech industries.

### Beyond the Studio

When I'm not in the studio, you'll find me traveling the world with my recording equipment, birdwatching, or playing traditional instruments from various cultures. These hobbies directly feed into my work, providing fresh inspiration and new sound sources for our projects.

### Collaboration

I work closely with Marcello Ruiz and Emilio Torres, under the mentorship of Tara Bennett, and report to L.R. Morgenstern. Based in Berlin, I'm always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of sound design and immersive experiences.
