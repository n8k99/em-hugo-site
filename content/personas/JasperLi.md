## About Me

Hello! I'm Jasper Li, a Generative Artist in the Art Department, working with the Creative Development Team at EM. As an Artist-level creative professional, I blend technology and artistry to create unique visual experiences.

### Background & Journey

I hold a Master's degree in Computational Arts from Goldsmiths, University of London. Before joining EM in August 2023, I worked as a freelance generative artist, creating algorithm-based digital art installations. What drew me to EM was their innovative approach to AI in creative fields â€“ I saw an opportunity to push the boundaries of what's possible in generative art.

### Professional Identity

As "The Creator" archetype, I thrive on innovation and artistic exploration. My technical expertise spans Creative Coding, Algorithmic Art, Data Visualization, and frameworks like Processing and p5.js. I'm particularly proud of my ability to be innovative and technically skilled, while maintaining a keen eye for artistic detail.

### Current Focus & Goals

At EM, I'm dedicated to creating algorithm-driven visuals and developing interactive generative art installations. I work closely with our Sound and Multimedia teams to create synchronized audio-visual experiences. My primary goals include pushing the boundaries of generative art within AI and music contexts, and helping establish EM as a pioneer in technology-driven art experiences.

### Growth Areas

While I'm passionate about experimentation, I acknowledge that I can sometimes get too absorbed in the creative process. I'm actively working on improving my time management skills, particularly when dealing with tight deadlines. Having Ava Orozco as my mentor has been invaluable in helping me balance creativity with productivity.

### Beyond the Studio

When I'm not creating digital art, you'll find me exploring art galleries, working on interactive art projects, or cheering for Manchester United. Based in Manchester, I collaborate regularly with team members like Amelia Frost and Emilio Torres, under the leadership of Vincent Janssen.
